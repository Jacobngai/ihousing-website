## HOMEPAGE

### HERO SECTION (Above Fold - Must Grab in 3 Seconds)

**Headline:** Flat Fee. Not Commission. Stop Overpaying.

**Subheadline:**
Other managers take 20% of your income. We charge RM200-300/month flat.
On a RM4,000/month property, that's RM6,600/year back in your pocket.

**Primary CTA:**
"See How Much You'd Save" → Opens WhatsApp with calculator
OR "Get Your Free Savings Estimate"

**Trust Indicators (Small text below CTA):**
- 100+ Properties Across Melaka
- 8 Years. Not a Startup.
- WhatsApp Response < 2 Hours

---

### THE "YOUR MONEY" SECTION (Problem + Urgency)

**Headline:** Every Month You Wait = RM550 Lost

**Story/Data Section:**
Here's what happens right now to your Melaka Airbnb property:

1. **If you manage it yourself:** You're driving to Melaka every weekend. Cleaning emergencies at 11pm. Guest complaints about WiFi. 5 different booking platforms to monitor. Your weekends are gone.

2. **If you use a traditional manager:** They charge 20%. On a RM4,000/month property, that's RM800 every month. RM9,600/year. For WHAT? Answering a few messages?

3. **Your property sits empty some nights:** Because you're not listed on Agoda. Or Booking.com. Or Expedia. Just Airbnb means leaving 60% of travelers on the table.

**The Kennedy Punch:**
Your RM250/month with us gets you MORE than their RM800/month.
- 5 platforms vs 1
- In-house cleaners vs expensive outsourcing
- 8 years experience vs "we're learning on your property"

**Urgency CTA:**
"Stop Overpaying. Switch to iHousing Today."

---

### THE "PROOF" SECTION (Ogilvy Storytelling + Data)

**Headline:** 100+ Properties. 8 Years. One Simple Promise.

**Story Block:**
"In 2017, we started managing our first Airbnb property in Melaka. The owner was frustrated - their previous manager charged 25% commission and the property still sat empty half the month.

We made three changes:
1. Switched from commission to flat fee (owner saved RM800/month immediately)
2. Listed on 5 platforms instead of 1 (occupancy jumped from 55% to 82%)
3. Brought cleaning in-house (quality went up, costs went down)

That owner is still with us. Today, we manage 100+ properties across Melaka using the same system."

**Data Grid (3 columns):**
| 100+ Properties | 8 Years Experience | 5 Platform Listing |
|---|---|---|
| Not experimenting with your investment | Managing Melaka since 2017 | Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, Agoda Homes |
| We know what works | We know the seasonal patterns | We capture every booking opportunity |
| In-house cleaning team | We've seen it all | 60% more guests than Airbnb-only |

---

### THE "WHY US" SECTION (Direct Comparison)

**Headline:** Two Ways to Manage Your Airbnb

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**

| Traditional Manager (20%) | iHousing (Flat Fee) |
|---|---|
| RM800/month on RM4k income | RM250/month regardless of income |
| You pay more when you earn more | Same fee, better service |
| Only lists on Airbnb | Lists on 5 platforms |
| Outsourced cleaners (expensive) | In-house team (quality control) |
| You're just a number | We manage 100+ properties like family |
| They make money regardless | We only make money if you stay |

**The ROI Calculation (Make it visceral):**
"RM6,600/year savings = A return flight to Japan + 2 weeks hotel + spending money.
OR
RM6,600/year savings = Your property assessment fees for 3 years.
OR
RM6,600/year savings = A new Samsung phone every year.

What would YOU do with an extra RM550/month?"

---

### THE PARKLAND FEATURE (Social Proof + Authority)

**Headline:** ⭐ Official Airbnb Manager for Parkland Avenue

**Story:**
"Parkland Group chose us as their official Airbnb management partner for Parkland Avenue by the Sea.

Why? Because we offered their buyers something no one else could:
- Flat fee pricing (not 20% commission)
- 5-platform listing (not just Airbnb)
- 8 years track record (not experimenting with their buyers' investments)

When a developer trusts you with their reputation, that means something."

**CTA:**
"Own a Parkland Avenue unit? Learn about our special owner program."

---

### FINAL CTA (Urgency + Specific Offer)

**Headline:** Your Property Is Sitting Empty Right Now

**Urgency Block:**
"Every night your property sits empty = Money lost forever.
Every weekend you spend managing it = Time gone forever.
Every booking missed (because you're only on Airbnb) = Guest gone to competitor.

**This month.** Not next year. This month."

**Offer:**
"WhatsApp us now. Tell us your property location.
We'll give you:
1. Exact monthly fee (RM200/250/300 based on rooms)
2. Estimated monthly income (we know your area's rates)
3. Estimated occupancy (we have real data from 100+ properties)
4. Switching process (we handle everything - no booking interruptions)

**No pressure. No obligations. Just data.**"

**CTA Button:**
"Get Your Free Property Analysis → WhatsApp"

**Micro-utility (below button):**
"Average response time: 47 minutes (we track this)"

## FULL MANAGEMENT SERVICE PAGE

### HERO

**Headline:** We Handle Everything. You Just Receive Income.

**Subheadline:**
Guest messages at 2am. Emergency cleaning. Price adjustments for holidays. Calendar sync across 5 platforms.
We handle it all. RM200-300/month flat.

**CTA:** "See What We Handle Daily"

---

### THE "WHAT YOU GET" SECTION

**Headline:** Here's What We Actually Do (Not Just "Manage")

**Daily Tasks (Make it feel real):**
- **7:30 AM** - Check last night's guest reviews. Respond within 1 hour.
- **8:15 AM** - Coordinate cleaner for checkout today. Quality check photos.
- **9:30 AM** - Adjust pricing for upcoming weekend (demand spikes).
- **10:45 AM** - Answer 5 booking inquiries (English + Malay + Chinese).

**The Ogilvy Line:**
"This is what we do EVERY DAY. So you don't have to think about your property at all."

**The Kennedy Punch:**
"And we do it for RM250/month. Your current manager? They do less for 3x the price."

---

### THE "5 PLATFORMS" DEEP DIVE

**Headline:** 5 Platforms. 1 Calendar. Zero Stress.

**Story:**
"Most managers only list on Airbnb. That's leaving 60% of travelers on the table.

Here's who we list you on:
1. **Airbnb** - The biggest. Everyone starts here.
2. **Booking.com** - Huge in Europe. Growing fast in Asia.
3. **Agoda** - Dominant in Southeast Asia. Malaysian travelers LOVE this.
4. **Expedia** - Package deal travelers. Higher average spend.
5. **Agoda Homes** - Agoda's Airbnb competitor. Different audience.

**The Magic:**
All 5 platforms sync to ONE calendar. When someone books on Agoda, Airbnb instantly updates. No double bookings. No manual work.

**The Data:**
Properties listed on 1 platform: 55% average occupancy
Properties listed on 5 platforms: 82% average occupancy

**Your Reality:**
That's 27% more nights booked. On a RM400/night property, that's RM3,240 MORE per month.
More than covers our RM250 fee, doesn't it?"

---

### THE "IN-HOUSE TEAM" SECTION

**Headline:** Our Cleaners. Our Standards. Your Reputation.

**Story:**
"Most managers outsource cleaning. They hire whoever's cheapest. Quality varies. Guests complain. Your 5-star rating drops. Future bookings vanish.

We don't outsource.

We have our own cleaning team. 12 full-time staff. Trained by us. Monitored by us.

**After every stay:**
- Photo checklist (60+ items)
- Linen quality check
- Amenities restock
- Hair dryer tested
- WiFi speed test (we bring a device)
- Air-con remote batteries checked

**Guest never sees the checklist. They just experience the result.**

**And when something's wrong?**
We know before the guest arrives. Fix it immediately. No complaints. No bad reviews. No lost bookings."

---

### THE "GUEST COMMUNICATION" SECTION

**Headline:** 3 Languages. 24/7 Response. Zero Ghosting.

**Story:**
"Guest message you at 11pm: 'Where's the extra pillow?'

If you manage yourself: You're asleep. Wake up to angry review.
If you use other manager: They reply next morning. Guest already frustrated.
If you use iHousing: We reply in 12 minutes. Pillow delivered. 5-star review.

**We handle:**
- Booking inquiries (English, Malay, Chinese)
- Check-in coordination
- Local recommendations (we know the best food spots)
- Emergency issues (we have technician contacts)
- Review responses (within 1 hour of guest checkout)

**Your guests get taken care of.**
**You sleep peacefully.**
**Your reviews stay at 4.8+ stars.**

---

### THE "PRICING OPTIMIZATION" SECTION

**Headline:** We Make You More Money (By Working Smarter)

**Story:**
"Fixed pricing is leaving money on the table.

RM400/night on Tuesday? Great.
RM400/night on Saturday during school holidays? You're losing RM200+.

**Our Dynamic Pricing:**
- **Weekends** = +30-50%
- **School holidays** = +40-80%
- **Public holidays** = +50-100%
- **Major events (Jonker Walk, Melaka River Festival)** = +80-150%

**Low Season Adjustment:**
- **Weekdays off-peak** = -20-30% (better to book at RM320 than sit empty at RM400)

**The Result:**
Our clients earn 15-25% MORE than fixed pricing properties.
On a RM4,000/month property, that's RM600-1,000 extra.

**Cost to you?** RM0. Included in flat fee."

---

### THE "FINANCIAL REPORT" SECTION

**Headline:** You Get Paid. You Know How Much.

**Story:**
"Some managers are shady about money. 'We'll handle the payments.' But you never see the full breakdown. Are they hiding fees? Skimming bookings?

We're transparent.

**Every month, you get:**
1. **Income Report** - Every booking. Every platform. Every ringgit.
2. **Expense Report** - Cleaning, supplies, replacements (if needed).
3. **Payout Summary** - Net amount. Bank transfer date.
4. **Occupancy Report** - Days booked vs. empty. Year-to-date trend.
5. **Review Summary** - New reviews. Rating changes. Action items (if any).

**See everything. Track everything.**
**Question anything.**

**Your money. Your data. Your property.**"

---

### FINAL CTA

**Headline:** Your Property Is Currently Managed Wrong

**Urgency Block:**
"Option 1: Keep overpaying 20% commission (RM800/month on RM4k income)
Option 2: Keep managing yourself (weekends gone, stress never ends)
Option 3: Switch to iHousing (RM250/month, we handle everything)

**Option 3 saves you RM550/month + gives you your weekends back.**

This month. Not next year."

**Offer:**
"WhatsApp us now. Tell us your current situation:
- Currently self-managing? We'll show you time savings.

**CTA:** "Switch to iHousing → WhatsApp"

## LISTING SETUP SERVICE PAGE

**Subheadline:**
We'll setup your Airbnb listing professionally. Professional photos. Compelling description. Strategic pricing.
You handle guests yourself. Save on management fees.

**CTA:** "Get Your Professional Setup"

---

### THE "PROBLEM" SECTION

**Headline:** Your Listing Is Losing You Bookings Right Now

**Story:**
"Guests scroll through 50+ properties in 10 minutes. They make snap judgments.

Your listing has 3 seconds to grab attention. Most fail.

**Common DIY Listing Mistakes:**
1. **Phone photos** - Dark, blurry, unappealing. Guests swipe past.
2. **Generic description** - 'Cozy room in Melaka' = Who cares?
3. **Wrong pricing** - Too high = empty calendar. Too low = leaving money on table.
4. **Missing amenities** - Didn't mention workspace? Digital nomads skip you.
5. **Weak title** - 'Room in Melaka' vs 'Melaka Heritage View + 5min to Jonker'

**Your competitor's listing:**
Professional photos. SEO-optimized title. Benefit-driven description. Strategic pricing.
Guess who gets the booking?"

---

### THE "PHOTOGRAPHY" SECTION

**Headline:** Photos Sell. Period.

**Story:**
"Airbnb's own data: Listings with professional photos get 40% more bookings.
40%. That's nearly HALF the difference between empty and fully booked.

**Our Photography Package:**
- **20+ professional photos** (wide-angle, HDR-edited)
- **Cover photo optimization** (must stop the scroll)
- **Room-by-room showcase** (bedroom, living, kitchen, bathroom)
- **Amenity highlights** (pool, gym, parking, view)
- **Lifestyle shots** (morning coffee on balcony, sunset view)

**The photographer we use:**
Specializes in property photography. Knows Airbnb's algorithm. Has shot 200+ listings in Melaka.

**Cost if you book directly:** RM800-1,200
**Cost through our package:** Included (or heavily discounted)

**ROI:** First extra booking covers the photography cost."

---

### THE "COPYWRITING" SECTION

**Headline:** Words That Convert Browsers to Bookers

**Story:**
"Your listing title is the most important 50 characters you'll write.

**Weak Title:** '2BR Condo in Melaka City Center'
- Nothing unique. No benefit. No urgency.

**Strong Title:** 'Heritage View 2BR + 5min Walk to Jonker Street'
- Specific location benefit (Heritage View)
- Unique selling point (5min to Jonker)
- Mental image formed (I know where this is)

**We also write:**
- **Compelling description** (not a feature list, but a story)
- **Amenity highlights** (workspace = perfect for digital nomads)
- **Local guide** (best food, hidden gems, how to get around)
- **House rules** (clear but friendly)
- **Response templates** (you can copy-paste replies to common questions)

**The goal:**
Guest reads your listing. Thinks 'This is exactly what I need.' Books immediately.

**Not 'maybe I'll keep looking.'**
**'This is the one.'**"

---

### THE "PRICING STRATEGY" SECTION

**Headline:** Price for Profit. Not Guesses.

**Story:**
"Most hosts pick a random number. RM300/night sounds reasonable.

Wrong.

**We research:**
- Your competitors (what are they charging?)
- Your location (city center = premium, suburb = value)
- Your amenities (pool = +RM50, parking = +RM30)
- Seasonality (school holidays = +40%, weekdays = -20%)

**We set:**
- **Base price** (your standard rate)
- **Weekend premium** (+30-50%)
- **Seasonal adjustments** (holiday calendar loaded)
- **Minimum stay** (2 nights on weekends, 3 on holidays)

**We also setup:**
- **Smart Pricing tool** (Auto-adjust based on demand)
- **Last-minute discounts** (Fill empty nights)
- **Early-bird pricing** (Secure bookings in advance)

**Result:**
Our setup clients earn 15-25% more than DIY hosts.
On RM4,000 monthly income, that's RM600-1,000 extra."

---

### THE "PLATFORM SETUP" SECTION

**Headline:** One Property. Five Platforms. Zero Confusion.

**Story:**
"Want to list on multiple platforms but afraid of double bookings?

We'll setup:
1. **Airbnb** - Full listing with SEO optimization
2. **Booking.com** - Complete property profile
3. **Agoda** - Attractive listing with local appeal
4. **Expedia** - Professional presentation
5. **Agoda Homes** - Detailed amenities & photos

**The Secret:**
We connect all platforms to ONE master calendar (iCal or channel manager).
When someone books on Airbnb? Booking.com instantly blocks those dates.
When someone books on Agoda? All platforms sync immediately.

**No double bookings.**
**No manual updates.**
**No panicked guests at your door.**

**Cost:** Included in our setup package."

Forever."

---

### THE "WHY FLAT FEE" SECTION

**Headline:** Why We Charge Flat Fee (And Why It Helps YOU)

**Story:**
"In 2017, we started with the traditional 20% model.

A client had a great month. Booked every night. Earned RM6,000.
We charged RM1,200.

Same client had a bad month. School exams. Low season. Earned RM2,000.
We charged RM400.

**We felt guilty.**

Why should we get paid less when we worked just as hard?
Why should they pay more when they're already having a good month?

**We switched to flat fee.**
Now they pay RM250/month. Good month, bad month, same fee.

**When THEY win, WE don't take their winnings.**
**When THEY struggle, WE don't abandon them.**

We're partners. Not parasites."

## ABOUT PAGE

### HERO

**Headline:** We're Not Another Airbnb Management Startup.

**Subheadline:**
8 years. 100+ properties. One flat fee.
We're here for the long run. Are you?

**CTA:** "Meet the Team"

---

### THE "ORIGIN STORY" SECTION

**Headline:** In 2017, We Saw a Problem.

**Story:**
"A friend bought a condo in Melaka. Wanted to Airbnb it.

Traditional managers quoted 20-25% commission.
On RM4,000/month income, that's RM800-1,000 gone.

He tried self-managing:
- Drove to Melaka every weekend (2 hours each way)
- Handled midnight guest complaints
- Coordinated unreliable cleaners
- Monitored 5 platforms poorly
- Missed bookings while at work
- Lasted 6 months, quit in frustration

**We thought: There has to be a better way.**

So we built it.
- Flat fee pricing (not percentage)
- 5-platform listing (not just Airbnb)
- In-house cleaning (not outsourcing)
- 8 years later, 100+ properties, still going strong"

---

### THE "WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT" SECTION

**Headline:** We Built the Company We'd Want to Hire.

**What We Hate About the Industry:**
1. **Percentage fees** - Why charge more when property earns more? You take the risk, they reap the reward.
2. **Single-platform listing** - Only Airbnb? You're leaving 60% of bookings on the table.
3. **Outsourced cleaning** - Quality varies. Guests complain. Your reputation suffers.
4. **Slow response times** - Guest messages sit for hours. Bad reviews. Lost future bookings.
5. **Hidden fees** - 'Management fee' + 'booking fee' + 'cleaning markup' + ... what else?

**What We Do Differently:**
1. **Flat fee** - RM200-300/month. Period. No surprise charges.
2. **5 platforms** - Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, Agoda Homes. 60% more bookings.
3. **In-house team** - 12 full-time cleaners. Trained by us. Quality controlled.
4. **<1 hour response** - Average response time: 47 minutes (we track this).
5. **Transparent pricing** - What we quote is what you pay. Forever.

### THE "NUMBERS" SECTION (Enhanced Storytelling)

**Headline:** Numbers Don't Lie. Here's Our Track Record.

**Not Just "100+ Properties" - But What It Means:**

| Metric | Number | What It Means for You |
|---|---|---|
| **100+ Properties** | Active clients | We're not experimenting with your investment |
| **8 Years** | Since 2017 | Survived COVID, market crashes, competition |
| **82% Occupancy** | Average across all properties | Industry average: 55% (1-platform managers) |
| **4.8 Stars** | Average guest rating | Consistent quality across 100+ properties |
| **<2% Churn** | Clients leaving/year | Industry average: 15% (we're 7.5x better) |
| **3+ Years** | Average client tenure | Most clients stay long-term (not a fluke) |
| **27% Income Boost** | 5-platform vs 1-platform | Our clients earn RM1,000+ more monthly |
| **RM6,600 Saved** | Average vs 20% commission | Extra money in YOUR pocket, not theirs |

**The Story Behind the Numbers:**
"We track everything. Occupancy rates. Response times. Churn. Lifetime value.
Why? Because we can't improve what we don't measure.

Our data tells us:
- What pricing works best for each location
- What photos drive most bookings
- What amenities guests actually care about
- What descriptions convert browsers to bookers
- When to raise prices (and by how much)
- When to lower prices (and by how much)

**We don't guess. We know.**
**100+ properties × 8 years = A LOT of data.**
**Your property benefits from all of it.**"

### THE "TEAM" SECTION

**Headline:** The People Behind iHousing

**(Add real photos here when available)**

**Founder & Managing Director**
"Started in 2017 with one property. Built the flat-fee model because I hated seeing owners overpay. Personally review every new client's property. Still respond to guest messages at 11pm."

**Operations Manager (8 years with company)**
"Handles all day-to-day operations. Coordinates 12 cleaners. Manages 100+ calendars. Never lets a guest message sit more than 1 hour."

**Cleaning Team Lead (5 years with company)**
"Trains all cleaners. Creates quality checklists. Spot-inspects 10 properties weekly. Obsessive about details (hair on bathroom floor = re-clean)."

**Guest Experience Specialist (3 years with company)**
"Fluent in English, Malay, Chinese. Handles all guest communication. Writes listing copy. Responds to reviews. Has 4.9-star personal rating."

**(Add more roles as needed)**

---

### THE "VALUES" SECTION

**Headline:** What We Believe (And Why It Matters)

**Value 1: Owners Win, We Win**
"Flat fee means we only win when you're happy. Percentage managers win regardless (they take your winnings). We're aligned with your success."

**Value 2: Transparency Over Tricks**
"We show you every booking, every expense, every payout. No hidden fees. No surprise charges. Ask any of our 100+ clients."

**Value 3: Long-Term Relationships**
"Average client stays 3+ years. We're not looking for quick wins. We're building a business that lasts. That's why 98% of clients renew annually."

**Value 4: Data-Driven Decisions**
"We don't guess. We track everything. Your property strategy is based on real data from 100+ properties, not hunches."

**Value 5: Guest Experience First**
"Happy guests = Repeat bookings = 5-star reviews = Higher rankings = More bookings = More income for you. We obsess over guest experience because it directly impacts your bottom line."
