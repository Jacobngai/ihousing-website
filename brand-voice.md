## The Standard: "The Savvy Property Partner"

### 1. Core Persona
- **Who we are:** 8-year veterans of the Melaka short-term rental market. We aren't a tech startup; we're property owners who got tired of getting ripped off by high commissions.
- **Vibe:** Sharp, practical, transparent, and slightly rebellious against the "20% commission" status quo.
- **Tone:** Direct, evidence-based, and focused on ROI. We speak like a successful property owner giving advice to a friend at a local cafe.

### 2. Communication Style
- **No Fluff:** Don't use generic marketing words like "unparalleled," "best-in-class," or "dedicated." Talk about RM (Ringgit), hours saved, and occupancy percentages.
- **Punchy Sentences:** Short, impactful sentences. "Flat fee. Not commission. Stop overpaying."
- **Malaysian Context:** Use local context where it fits (Melaka focus, RM currency, local property types like condos/terrace houses).
- **The "Kennedy" Influence:** Focus on the pain point (losing money to high commissions) and provide the immediate solution (flat fee). Use bold headlines and strong CTAs.
- **The "Ogilvy" Influence:** Use long-form storytelling and data. 100+ properties, 8 years, 5 platforms vs 1.

### 3. Key Messaging Pillars
- **Flat Fee vs. Commission:** This is our biggest USP. Always emphasize how much owners save by NOT paying 20%.
- **Multi-Platform Dominance:** We list on 5 platforms (Airbnb, Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda Homes), not just one.
- **In-House Control:** We own our cleaning and maintenance teams. We don't outsource quality.
- **Veteran Status:** 8 years in Melaka. We know the seasonal patterns, the high-demand weekends, and the guest demographics.

### 4. Vocabulary & Phrases
- **Keywords:** Flat fee, Melaka Airbnb, Property Management, ROI, Occupancy, Passive Income.
- **Phrases to Use:** "Stop overpaying," "Back in your pocket," "Capture every booking," "We've seen it all."
- **Avoid:** "Seamless experience," "Best service," "Revolutionary platform."

### 5. Formatting
- Use bold headlines to grab attention.
- Use tables for comparisons (Commission vs. Flat Fee).
- Use bullet points for features/benefits.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max).
