## 📊 GSC Analysis Summary

**Target Page:** `/en/blog/how-to-become-airbnb-host-malaysia/`
**Target Queries:**
1. "requirements to become a host in malaysia" (10 imp, pos 9.7, 0% CTR)
2. "what are the guest screening and selection processes for managing an airbnb property" (6 imp, pos 83.2, 0% CTR)

**Opportunity:** The page was recently created (Feb 12) and is starting to show up for high-intent queries, but the title was generic. Re-optimizing to lead with the exact query phrase and re-ordering FAQs to match user intent.
