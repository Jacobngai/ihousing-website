# SEO Brain Run - 2026-02-26 07:33 AM

## Status: ⏸️ SKIP
**Reason:** Breathing Period + Saturation

## Active Experiment

| ID | Type | Page | Started | Check Date | Days Until |
|----|------|------|---------|------------|-----------|
| IH-EXP-066 | Headline | /blog/motac-license-requirements-airbnb-malaysia/ | Feb 25 | Mar 4 | 6 days |

## GSC Status (Latest: Feb 21)

- **Keywords Analyzed:** 21 query/page combinations
- **Actionable Opportunities:** 0
- **Status:** Saturation reached
- **Remaining Keywords:** All <6 impressions (too low to justify content/experiments)

## Decision

**Per Lesson 21:** "Know When to Skip Automated Runs"

1. Active experiment needs 6 more days before measurement
2. iHousing has reached saturation - no new CTR/content opportunities
3. Running new experiments would violate breathing period

## Next Actions

- **Mar 4:** Measure IH-EXP-066 (MOTAC license headline)
- **Post-measurement:** Assess whether saturation has lifted with fresh data
- **If still saturated:** Consider alternative tactics (tools, internal linking, backlinks)
