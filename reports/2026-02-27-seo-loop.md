**H1 Headline:**
- ❌ OLD: "Airbnb Management Melaka"
- ✅ NEW: "Stop Overpaying: Save RM10,000+ Yearly with iHousing Melaka"

**Rationale:**
- Brand voice: "Sharp, practical, transparent" - focus on the pain point (losing money to high commissions)
- Kennedy influence: Lead with the savings, not just service description
- Concrete RM value beats vague promises
