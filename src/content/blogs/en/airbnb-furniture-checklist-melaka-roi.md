# Airbnb Furniture Checklist for Melaka: What to Buy to Maximize ROI

You’ve got the keys to your Melaka condo. Now comes the part that either makes you a lot of money or drains your bank account: **Furnishing.**

Most new hosts in Melaka make one of two mistakes. They either go to IKEA and buy the cheapest possible furniture that breaks in three months, or they overspend on "designer" pieces that guests don't actually care about.

At iHousing, we manage 100+ properties across Melaka—from heritage homes in Jonker to high-rises like Silverscape and Parkland. We’ve seen exactly which furniture choices lead to 5-star reviews and which ones lead to midnight maintenance calls.

If you want to maximize your ROI in 2026, stop thinking like a decorator and start thinking like an investor. Here is the ultimate Melaka Airbnb furniture checklist.

---

## 1. The "Arctic Blast" Living Room

In Melaka's 34°C humidity, your living room isn't for looking at—it's for cooling down. 

### The Sofa: Fabric vs. Leatherette
*   **The Verdict:** Dark-colored fabric with removable, washable covers.
*   **Why:** Light colors will be ruined by a single spilled coffee. Leatherette (PU) peels in Melaka’s heat and feels sticky to guests coming in from the sun.
*   **iHousing Tip:** Always buy a 3-seater even for a 1-bedroom unit. Melaka is a family destination; people *will* try to squeeze an extra kid onto that sofa.

### The Smart TV: 43" Minimum
*   **The Verdict:** 43-55 inch 4K Smart TV.
*   **Why:** Don't bother with cable TV (Astro). Guests want Netflix and YouTube. 
*   **Action:** Ensure your WiFi is at least 100Mbps. In 2026, "Slow WiFi" is the #1 reason for 4-star reviews in Melaka.

## 2. The "Hotel-Grade" Bedroom

This is where your reviews are won or lost. If the guest doesn't sleep well, you don't get 5 stars. Period.

### The Mattress: Don't Cheap Out
*   **The Verdict:** 10-inch pocket spring mattress (Medium-Firm).
*   **Why:** Cheap foam mattresses sag after 6 months of heavy guest use. Pocket springs reduce motion transfer—essential for families sharing a bed.
*   **Investment:** Spend RM 800–1,200 here. It’s the most important piece of furniture in the house.

### Linens: The "White Only" Rule
*   **The Verdict:** 100% Cotton, 300+ thread count, **Plain White**.
*   **Why:** White linens can be bleached. Colored or patterned sheets look "dirty" to guests even when they are fresh. 
*   **The iHousing Standard:** We keep 3 sets of linens per bed. One on the bed, one in the wash, one in the cupboard for emergencies.

## 3. The Kitchen: "Quick Breakfast" Ready

Most guests in Melaka eat out (Jonker Street is too good to miss), but they expect a functional kitchen for mornings.

### The "Big Three" Appliances
1.  **Microwave:** Essential for heating up those leftover Satay Celup sticks.
2.  **Electric Kettle:** A high-quality one that doesn't leak.
3.  **Fridge:** A medium-sized fridge with a proper freezer. Mini-fridges are for hotels; Airbnb guests bring drinks and ice cream.

### Dinnerware: The +2 Rule
*   **The Verdict:** If your unit sleeps 4, provide 6 sets of plates, mugs, and cutlery.
*   **Why:** Things break. You don't want a guest calling at 8 PM because they only have 3 forks for 4 people.

---

## 4. The Melaka Essentials (Often Forgotten)

Because we operate specifically in Melaka, we know the local "pain points" that outsiders miss.

### Water Purifier (Coway/Cuckoo/Joven)
*   **The Verdict:** A basic benchtop water purifier.
*   **Why:** Melaka’s tap water can be brownish after heavy rain. Providing filtered water saves you from buying hundreds of plastic bottles and is a huge "Value Add" in your description.

### Blackout Curtains: 100% Blockage
*   **The Verdict:** Double-layer curtains with 100% blackout backing.
*   **Why:** Melaka sun hits hard at 7 AM. Guests on holiday want to sleep in. If your room is bright at sunrise, your "Sleep Quality" rating will drop.

## 5. ROI Comparison: Cheap vs. Strategic Furnishing

Let's look at the numbers for a typical 2-bedroom condo in Melaka Raya (e.g., Parkland).

| Item | "Cheap" Setup (IKEA Budget) | Strategic Setup (ROI Focused) | Impact on Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mattress** | RM 350 (Foam) | RM 950 (Pocket Spring) | Higher repeat guests |
| **Linens** | RM 80 (Patterned) | RM 180 (White Cotton) | 5-star Cleanliness rating |
| **TV** | RM 600 (Basic) | RM 1,200 (4K Smart) | Longer booking duration |
| **Water** | Bottled Water | Water Purifier | RM 0 recurring cost |
| **Total Cost** | **RM 12,000** | **RM 18,500** | |
| **Avg. Nightly**| **RM 180** | **RM 250** | **+RM 70/night** |

**The Result:** The "Strategic" setup pays for its higher cost in just **93 nights** of bookings. Everything after that is pure extra profit.

## 6. Where to Buy in Melaka?

We aren't sponsored by anyone, but these are the places our owners actually use:
*   **Furniture City (Melaka Raya):** Good for sofas and dining sets.
*   **Harvey Norman / Senheng:** For appliances with reliable warranties.
*   **Muji / IKEA (Online):** For aesthetic small items and kitchenware.

## Final Thoughts: The 8-Year Rule

At iHousing, we tell our owners: **"Furnish for the guest you want, not the guest you have."**

If you furnish with cheap, mismatched junk, you will attract guests who treat your place like junk. If you furnish with quality, durable, hotel-standard pieces, you attract families and professionals who pay higher rates and take care of your home.

**Feeling overwhelmed by the checklist?**

We offer a **Turnkey Furnishing Service** for our Melaka management clients. We handle the sourcing, the delivery, the assembly, and the "Airbnb-ready" styling. We know the exact pieces that fit in Silverscape elevators and Parkland layouts.

**Stop guessing. Start earning.**
