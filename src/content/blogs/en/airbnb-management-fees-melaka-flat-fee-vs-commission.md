# Airbnb Management Fees Melaka: Why You're Losing 20% (And How to Stop)

If you own a condo at **Silverscape**, **The Shore**, or **Parkland Residence** in Melaka, you're probably already hosting on Airbnb or thinking about it. But there’s a "hidden tax" that most property owners just accept without question: the **20% management commission**.

At iHousing, we’ve been managing properties in Melaka for over 8 years. We’ve seen it all. And we’re here to tell you: **The commission model is broken.**

In this guide, we’ll break down exactly how much you’re losing, why Melaka owners are switching to our flat-fee model, and how to maximize your ROI in 2026.

## The Math of 20% Commission: A Melaka Reality Check

Most Airbnb management companies in Melaka charge between 20% to 25% of your gross revenue. On paper, it sounds fair—they only make money when you make money.

But let's look at the actual Ringgit (RM).

| Monthly Revenue | 20% Commission | Your Loss (Yearly) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RM 3,000 | RM 600 | RM 7,200 |
| RM 5,000 | RM 1,000 | RM 12,000 |
| RM 7,000 | RM 1,400 | RM 16,800 |

If your property is a high-performer at **Jonker** or **Klebang** making RM5,000 a month, you are handing over **RM12,000 every year**. That’s enough for a luxury renovation, a downpayment on another unit, or just extra cash back in your pocket where it belongs.

## Why Flat Fee is the Savvy Choice for Melaka Owners

At iHousing, we don't think we deserve 20% of your hard-earned revenue just because it was a high-demand weekend like Hari Raya or Chinese New Year. 

Our work is the same whether your unit earns RM2,000 or RM6,000. Why should we take more of your profit when the market is doing the work?

### 1. Transparency You Can Take to the Bank
With a flat fee, you know exactly what your expenses are every month. No surprises on your statement. No "variable" fees that eat into your margins.

### 2. We Work Harder to Fill Your Unit
Unlike commission-based agents who might prioritize their "highest earning" units to get a bigger cut, our flat-fee model ensures every property gets the same veteran-level attention. We want you to stay with us for the next 10 years, not just the next 10 months.

### 3. In-House Quality Control
We don't outsource. iHousing owns our own cleaning and maintenance teams right here in Melaka. When a guest at **The Wave** has an issue at 11 PM, it's our people on the ground, not a random contractor.

## 5 Platforms vs. 1: Capturing Every Booking

Many "part-time" managers only list on Airbnb. That’s a rookie mistake in the 2026 Melaka market. 

To maximize occupancy, you need to be everywhere guests are looking. iHousing syncs your property across:
- **Airbnb** (The global standard)
- **Agoda** (Massive for Asian travelers)
- **Booking.com** (Preferred by corporate/European guests)
- **Expedia** (High-value group bookings)
- **Agoda Homes** (Targeted short-stay traffic)

By being on 5 platforms, we capture the traveler from Singapore, the family from KL, and the digital nomad from Europe.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is property management in Melaka worth it?
If you value your time, yes. Between guest screening, 24/7 check-ins, professional cleaning, and MOTAC compliance, it’s a full-time job. A professional manager usually increases occupancy by 30-40%, which more than covers their fee.

### How much are typical Airbnb management fees in Malaysia?
The national average is 20-25%. However, Melaka-specialists like iHousing offer flat-fee models that are significantly more profitable for owners with mid-to-high range properties.

### What is included in the iHousing flat fee?
Everything from professional photography and 5-platform listing management to guest screening, cleaning coordination, and monthly financial reporting.
