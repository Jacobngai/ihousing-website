# Airbnb Management Melaka: Why We're the Only Company Offering Flat Fees (Not 20% Commission)

You bought your Melaka property for one reason: **ROI**. 

But after the property agent takes their cut, the bank takes the installment, and the "standard" Airbnb management company takes their 20% to 30% commission... how much is actually left for you?

At iHousing, we’ve been in the Melaka market for 8 years. We aren't just managers; we're owners. And we got tired of seeing management companies get rich while owners took all the risk. 

**That’s why we do things differently. We don't charge commission. We charge a flat fee.**

## The Dirty Secret of Airbnb Management in Melaka

Most management companies in Melaka follow the same old model: They take 20% to 25% of your *gross* income. 

It sounds fair until you look at the math during peak seasons like Chinese New Year or school holidays. When your property makes RM10,000 in a month, they take RM2,500. Did they do 2.5x more work that month? No. They just took a bigger slice of your profit.

### The Commission Trap vs. The iHousing Flat Fee

Let’s look at a real comparison for a 2-bedroom condo at **Silverscape** or **Parkland Residence**:

| Monthly Gross Income | 25% Commission Model | iHousing Flat Fee | **Extra Profit in Your Pocket** |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| RM5,000 (Average)    | RM1,250              | RM750*            | **+RM500**                      |
| RM8,000 (Peak)       | RM2,000              | RM750*            | **+RM1,250**                    |
| RM12,000 (CNY/Mega)  | RM3,000              | RM750*            | **+RM2,250**                    |

*\*Example flat fee. Actual fee depends on unit size and service tier.*

**Stop overpaying for management.** Your property's success should benefit *you*, not just your manager.

## 8 Years in Melaka: We Know Every Nook and Cranny

We aren't a tech startup from KL trying to "disrupt" the market with an app. We’re Melaka locals who know exactly which weekends the Singaporeans are coming down and which weekdays the business travelers need a place in Melaka Raya.

### Why 100+ Owners Trust iHousing:

1.  **Multi-Platform Dominance:** Most managers just list you on Airbnb. We put you on **Airbnb, Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia, and Agoda Homes**. More platforms = higher occupancy = more RM back in your pocket.
2.  **In-House Cleaning & Maintenance:** We don't outsource quality. We have our own dedicated teams in Melaka. If a guest breaks a pipe at 2 AM in Klebang, we fix it. 
3.  **Veteran Pricing Strategy:** We don't "set and forget." We adjust your rates daily based on real Melaka demand data. 
4.  **Complete Transparency:** You see every booking, every expense, and every guest review. No hidden "admin charges."

## FAQ: Airbnb Management in Melaka

**"Is my property in the right area for Airbnb?"**
If you're in Jonker Walk, Melaka Raya, Klebang, or Ayer Keroh, the answer is usually yes. But location is only 50% of the battle—the other 50% is how you manage it.

**"What if my property is already listed?"**
No problem. We can take over existing listings, optimize the photos and pricing, and sync them across our 5-platform network. Most owners see a 15-20% jump in occupancy within the first 30 days.

**"Do you handle Motac licenses and local council requirements?"**
Yes. We stay up-to-date with all Melaka state regulations to ensure your investment stays legal and protected.
