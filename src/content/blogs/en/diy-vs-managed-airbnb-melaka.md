You bought a condo in Melaka thinking it would be easy passive income. Then came the midnight guest calls, the cleaning coordination, and the "where's the WiFi password" messages at 2am.

Sound familiar?

Every property owner we talk to faces the same question: **Should I manage my own Airbnb or hire someone?**

Here's the honest answer we give after managing 100+ properties in Melaka: it depends on your property, your goals, and — most importantly — how much of your time you're willing to give up.

Let's break down the real numbers, not the theory.

## The Reality of DIY Management

First, what does "DIY" actually look like in practice? Here's what you're signing up for:

| Task | Frequency | Time Required |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Responding to guest inquiries | Daily | 1-2 hours/day |
| Coordinating check-ins/check-outs | Per booking | 30 minutes each |
| Scheduling cleaning | Per booking | 15 minutes each |
| Restocking supplies | Weekly | 1-2 hours |
| Handling maintenance issues | As needed | 2-4 hours/month |
| Reviewing feedback and responding | Per stay | 30 minutes |
| Updating pricing across platforms | Weekly | 1 hour |

**Total monthly commitment:** 50-80 hours if you're fully hands-on

**The hidden cost:** You can't really "switch off." Guests message at all hours, and if you don't respond quickly, your Superhost status takes a hit.

### What DIY Gets You

**The good news:**
- You keep 100% of your revenue (no management fees)
- Full control over how your property is run
- Direct relationship with guests

**The bad news:**
- It's not really passive — it's a part-time job
- Guest experience depends entirely on you
- Limited growth — it's hard to scale beyond 1-2 properties

### When DIY Makes Sense

DIY works best if:

- **You live in or near Melaka** — handling local issues is much easier
- **You only have 1 property** — the workload is manageable
- **You enjoy hospitality** — you don't mind interacting with guests
- **Your time is flexible** — you can respond to messages throughout the day
- **Your property is low-maintenance** — new build, few potential issues

**Real example:** One of our clients, a retiree who lives in Melaka Raya, manages his own 2-bedroom unit. He enjoys meeting guests and handles everything himself. His property earns about RM 6,000/month net, and he keeps all of it.

**Time commitment:** About 15 hours/week. He treats it like a hobby.

## The Managed Approach

Now, what does "managed" actually mean? At iHousing, here's what we take off your plate:

| Service | What We Do |
|---------|-----------|
| Guest communication | 24/7 responses in minutes, not hours |
| Check-in/check-out | Professional handling, key exchange |
| Cleaning & laundry | Vetted cleaning team, quality-checked |
| Maintenance | Fix issues before guests notice them |
| Supplies restocking | Essentials always available |
| Pricing optimization | Dynamic pricing based on demand |
| Platform management | Listings across Airbnb, Booking.com, Agoda |
| Reviews management | Response to all reviews |
| Owner reporting | Monthly income statements |

### What Managed Gets You

**The benefits:**
- True passive income — we handle everything
- Professional guest experience — consistent 5-star reviews
- Better occupancy — optimized pricing and listings on multiple platforms
- Peace of mind — we handle the midnight calls
- Scalability — can manage multiple properties with zero extra work

**The trade-off:**
- You pay a management fee (more on this in a minute)
- Less direct control (though most owners prefer not dealing with day-to-day)

### When Managed Makes Sense

Managed works best if:

- **You live outside Melaka** — Singapore, KL, Penang, or overseas
- **You have multiple properties** — scaling becomes impossible with DIY
- **You have a full-time job** — can't be available for guests all day
- **You want truly passive income** — not a second job
- **Your property is high-value** — every day vacant costs you more

**Real example:** A Singaporean client owns 3 units in Melaka. He tried DIY for 6 months before switching to us. His occupancy jumped from 55% to 78%, and his net income increased by 35% — even after paying our fees.

**Before DIY:** RM 12,000/month gross, 55% occupancy
**After Managed:** RM 18,000/month gross, 78% occupancy (after our fee)

## The Money Question: DIY vs Managed

Let's do the math on a typical Melaka 2-bedroom condo (Silverscape, Parkland, etc.):

**Scenario: Typical 2-Bedroom Condo in Melaka**

| Factor | DIY | Managed |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Avg. daily rate | RM 250 | RM 250 |
| Occupancy rate | 60% | 78% |
| Gross monthly income | RM 4,500 | RM 5,850 |
| Cleaning costs | RM 600/month | RM 600/month |
| Maintenance | RM 300/month | RM 300/month |
| Management fee | RM 0 | RM 1,170/month (20% flat) |
| **Net monthly income** | **RM 3,600** | **RM 3,780** |

**The takeaway:** With better occupancy and pricing, managed can actually earn you more — even after fees.

### The Commission Trap (What Other Managers Don't Tell You)

Many property managers charge a **percentage commission** — typically 20-25% of your revenue. Here's why that hurts you:

**Commission pricing:**
- You pay more when your rates are high (CNY, school holidays)
- The manager's incentives aren't aligned with yours
- No cap on fees — you keep earning less as you earn more

**What we do: Flat fee percentage**

Our 20% flat rate means:
- Predictable costs for you
- You keep more when you earn more
- Aligned incentives — we succeed when you succeed

**Example with CNY surge pricing:**

| Scenario | Gross Income | Commission (25%) | Flat Fee (20%) | Your Net |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Normal month | RM 5,000 | RM 1,250 | RM 1,000 | +RM 250 |
| CNY month | RM 8,000 | RM 2,000 | RM 1,600 | +RM 400 |

**Over a year:** You save RM 2,000+ with flat-fee pricing on a single property.

## The "What If My Property Performs Poorly?" Question

This is the #1 fear property owners have: **"What if my Airbnb doesn't make money, but I still pay management fees?"**

It's a valid concern — which is why we handle it differently.

**What most managers do:** You pay regardless of performance. If your property sits empty, you still owe them.

**What we do:**
- We're selective about the properties we accept — if we don't think it can perform, we'll tell you upfront
- We optimize everything to maximize occupancy and rates
- If your property genuinely underperforms for 3+ months (through no fault of yours), we'll work with you on adjustments

**The truth:** In 5 years of managing properties in Melaka, we've only had 2 cases where a property didn't perform. Both were in locations with no tourism demand — and we told those owners before signing up.

## Hybrid Approach: What If You Want a Middle Ground?

Some property owners want the best of both worlds. Here are two hybrid options:

### Option 1: Guest Communication Only
We handle guest messages, inquiries, and check-ins. You handle cleaning and maintenance.

- **You keep:** 90% of revenue (10% management fee)
- **We handle:** Guest communication, check-ins
- **Best for:** Owners who enjoy some involvement but want help with guest interactions

### Option 2: Key Pickup Only
We just handle check-ins and key exchanges. You do everything else.

- **You keep:** 95% of revenue (5% management fee)
- **We handle:** Check-ins only
- **Best for:** Owners who want full control but can't be there for arrivals

## Decision Framework: What's Right for You?

Here's a quick way to decide:

| Factor | Choose DIY If... | Choose Managed If... |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Your location | Live in/near Melaka | Live outside Melaka |
| Your time | Flexible schedule | Full-time job |
| Your goal | Side income, hobby | True passive income |
| Property count | 1 property | 2+ properties |
| Guest interaction | Enjoy it | Don't want to deal with it |
| Emergency response | Can handle 24/7 | Want someone else to handle it |
| Monthly time available | 15+ hours | Under 5 hours |

**Score yourself:** If you said "Managed If..." to 4+ questions, you're likely better off with a property manager.

## The iHousing Approach

We're not trying to sell you on management — we want you to make the right decision for your situation. Here's what we do differently:

**We'll tell you if DIY makes sense**
- If you live in Melaka and have time, we'll recommend managing it yourself first
- Try it for 3-6 months, see if it works for you
- If you decide it's too much, we're here to help

**We offer a trial period**
- Start with managed service for 3 months
- See the results — occupancy, income, peace of mind
- If you're not satisfied, we'll help you transition back to DIY

**Transparent pricing, no surprises**
- Flat 20% fee, no hidden charges
- Cleaning costs are separate (you see exactly what you're paying for)
- Monthly reporting showing income, expenses, and net earnings

## Real Results: Owners Who Switched

Here's what happened when some owners switched from DIY to managed:

| Owner | Before (DIY) | After (Managed) | Net Change |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Singaporean (3 units) | RM 12,000/mo net, 55% occupancy | RM 15,120/mo net, 78% occupancy | +RM 3,120/mo |
| KL-based (1 unit) | RM 2,800/mo net, 45% occupancy | RM 3,150/mo net, 70% occupancy | +RM 350/mo |
| Penang retiree (2 units) | RM 5,500/mo net, 60% occupancy | RM 6,050/mo net, 75% occupancy | +RM 550/mo |

**The common thread:** Every owner said the same thing — "I wish I'd switched sooner."

## The Bottom Line

DIY management isn't wrong — it's just not for everyone. The right choice depends on:

1. **Where you live** — Are you local or remote?
2. **Your time** — Do you have 15+ hours/month to invest?
3. **Your goals** — Side income or true passive income?
4. **Your property count** — Scaling beyond 1-2 units is hard with DIY

If you're on the fence, try this:
- **Start with DIY** for 3 months if you're local
- **See if you enjoy it** and have the time
- **Switch to managed** if it becomes overwhelming

We're here either way — as a partner when you're ready, or as a resource when you have questions about managing your own Airbnb.
