# Guest Screening and Selection: The iHousing Guide for Melaka Airbnb Hosts

You bought a condo in Melaka—maybe at Silverscape or Parkland—thinking it would be a straightforward investment. But then the "What Ifs" start creeping in.

*What if guests throw a party and disturb the neighbors?*
*What if they damage the furniture I spent weeks picking out?*
*What if they're not who they say they are?*

If you’re managing your own Airbnb in Melaka, these aren't just "What Ifs"—they’re the things that keep you up at night. At iHousing, we manage over 100 properties across Melaka, from Jonker Street to Melaka Raya. We've seen it all, and we've developed a guest screening process that practically eliminates these headaches.

Here is the exact framework we tell our owners (and use ourselves) to ensure we only host guests who respect the property and the neighborhood.

## 1. The Power of the "First Impression" (Their Profile)

Guest screening starts before a single message is sent. When a booking request or inquiry comes in, the first thing we look at is the guest's Airbnb profile.

### Look for the "Verified" Badge
Airbnb does a decent job of identity verification. We always check if a guest has a "Government ID Verified" badge. If they don't, that’s our first yellow flag. We’ll politely ask them to complete their verification before we confirm the booking.

### Read Between the Lines of Reviews
Don't just look at the star rating. Look at *what* other hosts are saying. 
- **"Communication was great"** = Good.
- **"Followed house rules"** = Great.
- **"Left the place a bit messy but okay"** = Proceed with caution.
- **"Neighbors complained about noise"** = Immediate decline.

### The "New Account" Factor
Everyone has to start somewhere, so we don't automatically reject new accounts with zero reviews. However, we do subject them to a more rigorous messaging phase (see Step 2).

## 2. Our Secret Weapon: The "Pre-Booking Interview"

At iHousing, we don't just wait for Instant Bookings (in fact, for certain high-end units, we turn Instant Book off). We use the messaging phase as a "mini-interview."

Here are the 3 questions we almost always ask:
1. **"What brings you to Melaka?"** (Helps us identify if it's a family vacation, a business trip, or a potential party group).
2. **"How many guests will be staying in total?"** (Verify this against their booking request).
3. **"Have you had a chance to read our house rules regarding [No Smoking/No Parties]?"** (Forces them to acknowledge the most important rules).

**The Red Flag Answer:** If a guest is vague ("just hanging out with friends") or ignores the question about house rules, that’s usually a sign they aren't the right fit for your home.

## 3. Spotting the "Red Flags" in Melaka

Being local property managers in Melaka gives us a unique perspective on local guest patterns. Here are a few things we look out for:

| The Scenario | Why We Worry | Our Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local residents booking for 1 night** | High risk of a "staycation party" with friends who aren't on the guest list. | Ask for the specific occasion. If it's a "birthday party," we decline. |
| **Last-minute bookings (after 8 PM)** | Sometimes legitimate, but often "emergency" bookings from people who got kicked out of elsewhere or are looking for a party spot. | Stricter ID verification and a phone call before check-in. |
| **Asking for a discount immediately** | Guests who haggle on price are statistically more likely to be high-maintenance and leave poor reviews. | We stick to our flat-rate pricing. Quality guests value quality service. |

## 4. The Role of Technology: Beyond Human Intuition

While "gut feeling" is important, we back it up with technology.

### Noise Monitoring (Minut)
In sensitive residences like **The Shore** or **Atlantis**, we sometimes install noise monitors (like Minut). These don't record conversations (we value privacy!), but they alert us if the decibel level stays too high for too long. 

### External CCTV
We always have a camera at the entrance (never inside!). This allows us to verify the guest count. If a booking for 2 people turns into a group of 10 walking through the front door, we know about it instantly and can intervene.

## 5. Why "Selection" is Better Than "Collection"

It's tempting to accept every booking, especially during the quiet mid-week periods in Melaka. But one bad guest can cost you more in repairs, neighbor complaints, and stress than five good bookings are worth.

**The iHousing Philosophy:** We would rather have a property sit empty for a Tuesday night than risk it with a guest who shows major red flags. 

### What if you have a bad feeling?
As a host, you have the right to decline. Be professional, be polite, but be firm. 
*"Thank you for your interest! Unfortunately, we don't believe our property is the best fit for your specific needs at this time. We wish you the best in your search!"*

## Summary: The iHousing Screening Checklist

If you're managing your own unit, keep this checklist next to your laptop:
- [ ] Is their ID verified on Airbnb?
- [ ] Do they have positive reviews from other hosts?
- [ ] Did they clearly state their reason for visiting Melaka?
- [ ] Did they confirm the exact number of guests?
- [ ] Did they explicitly acknowledge the "No Smoking/No Party" rules?

## Don't Want to Handle the Screening Yourself?

Let's be honest: screening guests at 11 PM on a Friday night is not "passive income." It’s a job. 

That’s where we come in. When you partner with **iHousing**, we handle the entire guest lifecycle:
1. **Aggressive Screening:** We filter out the troublemakers so you don't have to.
2. **24/7 Communication:** We answer those midnight "how do I use the microwave" messages.
3. **Local Maintenance:** If something breaks, we're already in Melaka to fix it.
4. **Flat-Fee Management:** No complicated percentages. Just a clear, predictable fee.
