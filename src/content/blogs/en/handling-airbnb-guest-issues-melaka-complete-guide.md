You bought a condo in Melaka thinking it would be passive income. Then came the 2am messages: "The WiFi isn't working," "There's a cockroach," "My kid broke the TV remote."

Sound familiar? That's exactly why we started iHousing.

Running an Airbnb in Melaka isn't just about pretty photos and competitive pricing. It's about handling guest issues professionally, quickly, and in a way that still gets you 5-star reviews.

We've managed over 100 properties here for 8 years. We've seen it all—from guests who flood bathrooms to families who show up with twice the number of people they booked for. Here's our complete playbook for handling every common (and uncommon) Airbnb guest issue in Melaka.

## The Midnight Call Playbook

### Issue #1: "The Air Conditioning Isn't Cold Enough"

**Why This Happens in Melaka:**
Melaka's heat is unforgiving. Guests coming from Singapore or KL expect instant arctic blast. Your AC unit might be working fine at 24°C, but they want 18°C.

**The Fix:**

1. **Remote troubleshooting** (saves you a midnight drive):
   - Ask: "Is the remote showing the correct temperature?"
   - Walk them through: Mode (Cool, not Fan), Temperature (try 22°C first), Fan speed (Auto or High)
   - Check if they left windows/balcony door open

2. **The Melaka-specific solution:**
   - Remind them AC needs 15-20 minutes to cool the room
   - Suggest closing curtains (Melaka sun heats up condos fast)
   - Offer a standing fan as backup (we keep one in every unit)

3. **When it's actually broken:**
   - Apologize immediately
   - Offer: "We can send a technician first thing tomorrow morning (8am), or if you prefer we can help you move to another unit tonight"
   - Comp

ensate: Partial refund or free late checkout

**Pro tip:** Service AC units every 3 months in Melaka. The coastal humidity clogs filters fast.

### Issue #2: "There's No Hot Water"

**Common in:** Older Melaka condos with temperamental water heaters.

**Immediate Response:**
"I'm so sorry about this. Let me walk you through the reset process—it usually fixes it in 2 minutes."

**The Reset Process:**
1. Locate the water heater switch (usually in bathroom or outside)
2. Turn OFF for 30 seconds
3. Turn back ON
4. Wait 5 minutes for water to heat
5. Test the shower

**If Reset Fails:**
- Send maintenance first thing in the morning
- Offer alternative: "There's a gym with showers on Level 7, or we can arrange a room move"
- Compensation: RM50-100 refund or free breakfast voucher

**Prevention:**
We replace water heaters every 5-7 years. Cheaper than dealing with repeated failures.

### Issue #3: "The WiFi Is Too Slow / Not Working"

**The Number One Complaint in 2026:**
Remote work + streaming = WiFi is no longer optional. It's critical.

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- "Are you connected to the right network?" (guests sometimes connect to building's public WiFi)
- "How many devices are connected?" (families with 8 devices kill bandwidth)
- "What are you trying to do?" (4K Netflix ≠ checking email)

**Quick Fixes:**
1. Router restart: Unplug for 30 seconds, plug back in
2. Move closer to router
3. Disconnect unused devices
4. Switch to 5GHz network (if available)

**Long-Term Fix:**
Upgrade to **TIME 100Mbps minimum** for Melaka properties. We've seen bookings drop 20% when guests complain about slow WiFi in reviews.

Cost: RM139/month. Worth every sen.

### Issue #4: "There Are Ants / Cockroaches / Pests"

**Melaka Reality Check:**
Coastal city + tropical climate = pests are a constant battle. Even 5-star hotels deal with this.

**Immediate Response:**
"I'm really sorry you're seeing this. Melaka's coastal location means we have to stay vigilant. Let me help right away."

**The Fix:**
1. **For ants:** "There's ant spray under the kitchen sink. Spray the trail and wipe with a wet cloth."
2. **For cockroaches:** "There's Ridsect in the bathroom cabinet. We'll also send our cleaner first thing tomorrow to do a deep clean."
3. **For serious infestations:** Offer to move them to another unit or partial refund

**Prevention Strategy (iHousing Standard):**
- Monthly pest control service (RM80/month)
- Weekly deep clean includes checking for food crumbs
- Sealed containers for all kitchen items
- Regular inspections during turnovers

**Guest Psychology Tip:**
Acknowledge it quickly and fix it fast. Guests are surprisingly forgiving if you handle it professionally.

## The Property Damage Playbook

### Issue #5: Guest Breaks Something

**Common Breakages in Melaka Airbnbs:**
- TV remotes (kids throw them)
- Glassware (slippery hands)
- Bedside lamps (knocked over)
- Toilet accessories (rough handling)

**The Response Script:**
"Hi [Guest Name], we noticed [item] was damaged during your stay. These things happen! The replacement cost is RM[amount]. We can either:
1. Charge it to the card on file
2. Deduct from your security deposit
3. You can replace it before checkout

What works best for you?"

**Pricing Guide for Common Items:**
- TV remote: RM50-80
- Drinking glass: RM10-15
- Bedside lamp: RM100-150
- Towels (stained): RM30-50 each

**When to Let It Go:**
Items under RM50? Sometimes it's not worth the hassle. Chalk it up to cost of doing business. Your review matters more.

### Issue #6: Major Property Damage

**Examples We've Dealt With:**
- Clogged toilet causing overflow (guest flushed baby wipes)
- Cigarette burns on furniture (despite "no smoking" policy)
- Stained walls from red wine spill
- Broken bed frame (don't ask)

**Documentation Process:**
1. **Take photos immediately** (timestamp matters)
2. **Get repair quotes** (2-3 quotes for credibility)
3. **Contact guest within 24 hours** of checkout
4. **File Airbnb claim** (within 72 hours of checkout or before next guest checks in)

**The Message Template:**
"Hi [Guest Name],

During our checkout inspection, we discovered [specific damage]. I've attached photos showing [describe damage].

We've obtained repair quotes:
- [Company 1]: RM[amount]
- [Company 2]: RM[amount]

Total: RM[amount]

We'll be filing an Airbnb resolution request for this amount. If you'd like to discuss this or have any questions, please let me know within 24 hours.

Best regards,
[Your name/iHousing Team]"

**Airbnb's Process:**
- You have 72 hours to file
- Guest has 72 hours to respond
- Airbnb mediates if disputed
- You need: Photos, quotes, proof of damage

**Success Rate:**
With proper documentation, we recover 80-90% of legitimate damage claims.

## The "Difficult Guest" Playbook

### Issue #7: Guest Shows Up with Extra People

**The Scenario:**
Booked for 4 people. Shows up with 7.

**Why It Matters:**
- Building rules (fire safety, occupancy limits)
- Your insurance (usually capped at listed capacity)
- Wear and tear (more people = more damage)
- Neighbor complaints

**The Response (Firm but Fair):**
"Hi! I see you have [number] people with you, but the booking was for [original number]. For safety and building compliance, we can either:

1. You pay the extra guest fee now (RM[amount] per person per night)
2. We help some of your group find a nearby unit

What would you prefer?"

**Pricing:**
Extra guest fee: RM30-50 per person per night (set this in your listing!)

**If They Refuse:**
- Document the violation (photos, messages)
- Notify building management if it violates condo rules
- Last resort: Contact Airbnb for early termination (you'll need proof)

**iHousing Approach:**
We catch this at check-in. Our automated message 24 hours before arrival asks: "How many people will be checking in?" If the number doesn't match, we address it BEFORE they arrive.

### Issue #8: Noise Complaints from Neighbors

**Melaka Context:**
- Condos have thin walls
- Singaporean weekend groups can get loud
- Building management takes complaints seriously

**When You Get the Complaint:**
1. **Act within 30 minutes** (before it escalates)
2. **Contact guest immediately:**

"Hi [Guest], we've received a noise complaint from neighbors. I know you're here to have fun, but we need to keep noise down after 10pm (building rules). Can you help us out? Thanks!"

**Tone:** Friendly but firm. Don't accuse, just inform.

3. **Follow up with neighbor:**
"We've spoken to the guests. Really sorry about this. Please let us know if it continues."

4. **Document everything** (messages, timestamps, complaints)

**If It Continues:**
- Second warning to guest (more serious tone)
- Threaten early checkout (rarely needed, but it works)
- File report with building management

**Prevention:**
- Include "quiet hours" in house rules (10pm-8am)
- Send automated reminder on check-in day
- Screen guests (we decline obvious party bookings)

### Issue #9: Guest Requests Early Check-In / Late Checkout

**Default Response:**
"Our standard check-in is 3pm and checkout is 11am. Let me check if we can accommodate your request!"

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Check cleaning schedule
- Check next guest arrival time
- Calculate opportunity cost

**Early Check-In:**
- **If available:** "Good news! The unit is ready. You can check in at [time]. Enjoy!"
- **If not available:** "The previous guest just checked out and cleaning is in progress. Earliest we can do is [time]. Would that work?"
- **Charge?** We don't charge for 1-2 hours early. Goodwill = better reviews.

**Late Checkout:**
- **If available:** "You can check out at [time] at no extra charge."
- **If tight turnaround:** "Unfortunately we have another guest arriving at 3pm. We can offer late checkout until 1pm for RM[amount], or free luggage storage at [location]."

**Pricing Late Checkout:**
- +2 hours: Free
- +4 hours: RM50-100
- +6+ hours: Half day rate (RM80-150)

## The Emergency Playbook

### Issue #10: Locked Out Guest

**Time Sensitivity:** URGENT. Guest is standing outside.

**Solutions (Fastest to Slowest):**
1. **Digital lock:** Regenerate code remotely, send via WhatsApp (2 minutes)
2. **Lockbox:** Remind them of location, send photo/video guide (5 minutes)
3. **Spare key:** Send someone with spare key (30-60 minutes)
4. **Building security:** Sometimes they can help if you've registered the guest
5. **Locksmith:** Last resort (RM150-300, takes 1-2 hours)

**iHousing Standard:**
We use digital locks on all managed properties. Problem solved remotely 95% of the time.

Cost: RM800-1,200 per lock. Pays for itself in saved midnight drives.

### Issue #11: Medical Emergency

**Rare but Serious:**
Guest slips in bathroom, food poisoning, chest pains, etc.

**Your Response (Immediate):**
1. "Are you okay? Do you need an ambulance?"
2. If yes: "I'm calling 999 now. Stay on the line with me."
3. Call 999, provide:
   - Address: [Full condo address, unit number]
   - Situation: [Brief description]
   - Contact: [Your number]

**Nearest Hospital Info (Have This Ready):**
- **Melaka Hospital:** Jalan Mufti Haji Khalil, 75400 Melaka
- **Distance from common areas:** 5-15 minutes
- **Emergency number:** 999 (ambulance)
- **Hospital direct:** 06-289 2344

**Follow-Up:**
- Check on guest next day
- Offer assistance (need anything? pharmacy run?)
- Document incident (insurance purposes)

**Never:**
- Ignore a medical emergency
- Assume they're exaggerating
- Delay calling for help

Your reputation isn't worth someone's health.

### Issue #12: Building Issues (Power Outage, Water Cut, Elevator Breakdown)

**Not Your Fault, But Still Your Problem:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Inform guest immediately:**
"Hi [Guest], there's a [issue] affecting the building. Building management says it'll be fixed by [time]. Really sorry for the inconvenience!"

2. **Provide alternatives:**
- Power outage: Flashlights, portable fan, move to café nearby
- Water cut: Bottled water provided, gym showers available
- Elevator: "We're on level [X], stairs are accessible"

3. **Compensation (If Major):**
- 4+ hour outage: RM50-100 refund
- Full day: Partial refund or free extra night

**Prevention:**
Check building notices weekly. Some condos announce maintenance in advance—warn your guests proactively.

## The "Unreasonable Request" Playbook

### Issue #13: Guest Demands Impossible Things

**Real Examples We've Received:**
- "Can you have someone watch my kids while I go out?"
- "The condo has a pool but it's too hot. Can you air-condition it?"
- "I don't like the view. Change my unit."
- "Make the neighbor's dog stop barking."

**The Diplomatic No:**
"I really wish we could help with that, but [reason]. What I CAN do is [reasonable alternative]. Would that work?"

**Examples:**
- Babysitting: "We can't provide childcare, but I can recommend a licensed service in Melaka."
- Pool: "Unfortunately we can't control the pool temperature, but early morning (7-9am) is cooler if you'd like to swim then."
- View: "I'm sorry the view isn't what you expected. Our listing photos show [what they saw]. If you'd like, we can help you find a different property for your next visit."
- Neighbor's dog: "I understand the noise is frustrating. We've contacted the neighbor. In the meantime, we have earplugs in the bathroom cabinet."

**When to Stand Firm:**
Some requests are outside your control and beyond reasonable hospitality. Politely decline, offer alternatives, and move on.

Don't let unreasonable guests bully you into impossible commitments.

## The Review Damage Control Playbook

### Issue #14: Guest Threatens Bad Review

**The Message:**
"If you don't refund me / fix this / give me [demand], I'll leave you a 1-star review."

**Never:**
- Panic and give in immediately
- Get defensive or argumentative
- Ignore the threat

**Do This Instead:**
"I'm really sorry you're not happy with [issue]. I want to make this right. What would be a fair resolution?"

**Then:**
- Address legitimate concerns immediately
- Offer reasonable compensation
- Document everything

**If the demand is unreasonable:**
"I understand you're frustrated. We've [done X, Y, Z] to address your concerns. If you'd like to escalate this, please contact Airbnb support and they can mediate."

**Airbnb Will Remove Reviews If:**
- Guest made threats/extortion
- Review contains profanity or personal attacks
- Review violates content policy

But you need proof (screenshots of messages).

### Issue #15: Dealing with the Actual Bad Review

**It Happened. They Left 2 Stars.**

**Step 1: Don't React Immediately**
Wait 24 hours. Responding while angry = bad idea.

**Step 2: Analyze the Review**
- Is it fair criticism? (WiFi was slow → you know it was)
- Is it unfair? (Complained about location → it's clearly listed)
- Is it factually wrong? (Said no AC → unit has 3 AC units)

**Step 3: Respond Professionally**

**For Fair Criticism:**
"Thank you for your feedback. We're sorry the WiFi didn't meet your expectations. We've since upgraded to 100Mbps to ensure better connectivity for future guests. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention."

**For Unfair Complaints:**
"We're sorry you felt this way. The property location is clearly indicated in our listing photos and map. We've managed 100+ properties in this area and most guests love the heritage neighborhood proximity. We're always happy to answer location questions before booking."

**For Factually Wrong:**
"We're surprised to hear this feedback, as the unit has 3 air-conditioning units (bedrooms and living room), all serviced monthly. We wonder if there was a confusion with the unit or perhaps a temporary malfunction we weren't notified about. We're always available for immediate support."

**The Formula:**
1. Acknowledge (even if you disagree)
2. State facts (without being defensive)
3. Show you care about improvement

**Remember:**
Future guests read your response. They're not judging the complaint—they're judging how you handle it.

## The Bottom Line

Running an Airbnb in Melaka is a business. Guest issues are part of the deal.

The difference between struggling hosts and successful ones? **Speed and professionalism.**

- **Fast response:** Issues get smaller when you address them immediately
- **Clear communication:** Guests forgive problems when you keep them informed
- **Fair solutions:** Reasonable compensation = better reviews
- **Professional boundaries:** Know when to say no (politely)

We've handled thousands of guest issues over 8 years. The ones that turn into disasters? Almost always because the host:
1. Responded too slowly
2. Got defensive
3. Didn't follow up
4. Tried to avoid reasonable compensation

Don't be that host.

**Want the peace of mind that comes with 24/7 professional support?**

For Parkland Avenue by the Sea, we offer flat-fee management (RM200-300/month) that includes everything: guest communication, issue resolution, maintenance coordination, and damage claims.

For other Melaka properties, we provide custom management tailored to your needs.

**WhatsApp us:** +60 11-6126 6688
