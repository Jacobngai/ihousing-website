# Melaka Airbnb Income: Real Monthly Earnings for 2026 (100+ Properties)

You bought a condo in Melaka because everyone said "Airbnb is passive income." Now you're wondering if that was actually true. Let's be honest — most people talk about Airbnb income in theory. We're going to show you the numbers.

We manage over 100 Airbnb properties in Melaka. That means we see the real data every month. Not the "best case scenario" numbers. Not the "I made RM15,000 once during CNY" stories. We're talking actual, consistent monthly income from different areas of Melaka.

## Quick Answer: The Real Numbers

Before we dive into the details, here's the realistic range for a standard 2-bedroom condo in Melaka:

| Area | Monthly Gross | Net After Costs | Occupancy Rate |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Jonker Walk vicinity** | RM6,000 - RM9,000 | RM4,200 - RM6,500 | 70-80% |
| **Klebang Beach** | RM4,500 - RM7,000 | RM3,000 - RM5,000 | 60-70% |
| **Melaka Raya** | RM5,000 - RM8,000 | RM3,500 - RM5,800 | 65-75% |
| **Bukit Beruang** | RM3,500 - RM5,500 | RM2,400 - RM3,900 | 55-65% |
| **Ayer Keroh** | RM3,000 - RM5,000 | RM2,000 - RM3,500 | 50-60% |

*Note: These are averages based on our portfolio. Your actual numbers will vary based on your specific property, furnishing quality, and management quality.*

## What Actually Affects Your Airbnb Income in Melaka?

### 1. Location Matters More Than You Think

Jonker Walk properties consistently earn 30-40% more than similar units in other areas. Why?

**Singapore weekend crowd:** A significant portion of Melaka's Airbnb guests are Singaporeans taking long weekend drives. They want to be near the heritage sites, food, and night markets. A 2-bedroom unit near Jonker Walk commands RM200-300 per night during weekends.

**Klebang Beach properties** earn less per night (RM150-200) but have higher weekday bookings from locals wanting a beach getaway. It's a different demographic — families and local tourists planning ahead.

**Melaka Raya** is the sweet spot for many properties. It's central enough to attract tourists but priced more affordably than Jonker. We see consistent occupancy here throughout the year.

### 2. Your Property Type Makes a Huge Difference

**Condos (Silverscape, The Apple, Parkland Avenue):**
- Pros: Amenities pool, gym, security. Higher nightly rates.
- Cons: Strata rules sometimes restrict Airbnb. Parking can be an issue.

**Serviced Apartments (The Majestic, Hatten Square):**
- Pros: Usually pre-approved for STR. Hotel-like amenities. Great location.
- Cons: Higher management fees. More competition in the same building.

**Landed Properties (Terrace houses in residential areas):**
- Pros: More space. Higher weekly rates for families.
- Cons: Maintenance is higher. Zoning issues in some areas.

### 3. Seasonality is Real in Melaka

Melaka has distinct peaks and troughs in Airbnb demand:

**Peak Periods (High Rates):**
- Chinese New Year (rates 2-3x normal)
- School holidays (March, June, September, December)
- Singapore public holidays (we get a LOT of Singaporean guests)
- Malacca Heritage Festival (April/May)

**Shoulder Periods (Normal Rates):**
- Regular weekends
- Long weekends that aren't major holidays

**Low Periods (Reduced Rates or Lower Occupancy):**
- Weekdays (except when there are conferences or events)
- Election periods (travel drops significantly)
- Ramadan fasting month (though not as much as in other states)

## The Reality of Airbnb Expenses

You don't get to keep every ringgit you earn. Here's what actually comes out of your gross income:

### Fixed Monthly Costs
- **Condo maintenance fee:** RM150-300/month
- **Internet/WiFi:** RM100-150/month
- **Insurance (STR-specific):** RM50-100/month
- **Utility base charges:** RM100-150/month

### Variable Costs (Per Stay)
- **Cleaning:** RM60-100 per turnover (higher for larger units)
- **Guest supplies:** RM10-15 per stay (toilet paper, soap, etc.)
- **Maintenance fund:** 2-3% of income (repairs, replacements)
- **Management fee:** 15-20% of gross (if hiring a company)

### The Real Net Income Calculation

For a Melaka Raya 2-bedroom unit earning RM5,800/month gross:

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Gross Income | RM5,800 |
| Condo maintenance | RM200 |
| WiFi | RM120 |
| Insurance | RM80 |
| Utilities (avg) | RM250 |
| Cleaning (12 turnovers × RM70) | RM840 |
| Supplies | RM180 |
| Maintenance fund (3%) | RM174 |
| **Total Expenses** | **RM1,844** |
| **Net Income** | **RM3,956** |

That's a realistic ~68% of gross income becoming net income. Properties with higher turnover (more cleaning needed) have lower margins.

## Airbnb vs Long-Term Rental: The Comparison

Many owners ask: "Should I do Airbnb or just rent it out long-term?"

Here's a real comparison for a similar 2-bedroom condo in Melaka Raya:

| Aspect | Airbnb (Managed) | Long-Term Rental |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Monthly Income | RM3,500 - RM5,800 | RM1,500 - RM2,200 |
| Effort Required | Low (if managed) | Very Low |
| Risk | Occupancy fluctuates | Tenant reliability |
| Control | You set price | Fixed contract |
| Wear & Tear | Higher (more guests) | Lower (fewer people) |
| Appreciation Potential | Higher (flexible use) | Standard |

The math is clear: Airbnb in Melaka can generate 2-3x more income than long-term rental, but it comes with higher management needs and more wear on your property.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Airbnb Income

After managing 100+ properties, we see the same mistakes repeatedly:

### Mistake 1: "I'll DIY and save the management fee"
Reality: Most DIY hosts burn out within 6 months. The midnight guest messages, last-minute cancellations, and cleaning coordination add up. Your time has value. Good management typically pays for itself through higher occupancy and better pricing.

### Mistake 2: Cheap furniture to "save money"
Reality: Guests won't return and won't leave good reviews. A saggy mattress or stained sofa shows up instantly in photos. Invest upfront in quality furniture. It lasts longer and commands higher rates.

### Mistake 3: Setting and forgetting your price
Reality: Melaka's Airbnb market is dynamic. Weekend rates should be 50-100% higher than weekday rates. School holidays need price adjustments. Competitors' prices change daily. Good hosts (or good management) adjust pricing weekly based on demand.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring reviews
Reality: A 4.2-star unit earns significantly less than a 4.9-star unit, even at the same location. The difference is attention to detail: fast WiFi, clean bathrooms, responsive communication.

## What You Can Realistically Expect

If you're just starting out with a standard 2-bedroom condo in Melaka:

**Year 1 (Learning Phase):**
- Occupancy: 40-50%
- Gross income: RM2,500 - RM4,000/month
- Reviews: Building up, some hiccups expected

**Year 2 (Stabilized):**
- Occupancy: 60-70%
- Gross income: RM4,000 - RM6,000/month
- Reviews: Established, return guests

**Year 3+ (Optimized):**
- Occupancy: 70-80%
- Gross income: RM5,000 - RM8,000/month
- Reviews: Superhost status possible

These are realistic expectations. The "I made RM20,000 in one month" stories are usually during peak CNY periods and are not sustainable year-round.

## Is Airbnb Right for Your Property?

Ask yourself these honest questions:

1. **Is your location actually desirable?** Being 20 minutes from any attraction makes a big difference.
2. **Can you afford to furnish it properly?** Cheap furniture = cheap reviews = low occupancy.
3. **Do you have time or budget for management?** Either manage it well or pay someone who does.
4. **Are you in it for the long term?** Airbnb takes 6-12 months to build momentum. Quick flips don't work.

## FAQ: Airbnb Income in Melaka

### How much can I make from Airbnb in Melaka if I have a 3-bedroom unit?
3-bedroom units typically earn RM6,000-10,000/month gross in prime locations, but they also have higher cleaning costs (RM80-120 per turnover). The net margin is usually similar to 2-bedroom units — more income, more work.

### Is it still profitable to start Airbnb in Melaka in 2026?
Yes, but the market is more competitive than before. The easy money (any furnished unit earning RM5,000+) is gone. Now it's about quality: better photos, better amenities, better management, better reviews.

### What percentage of income should I expect as net profit?
After all expenses (cleaning, utilities, maintenance, management fees), you should expect 60-70% of gross income as net profit. Units with high occupancy and low turnover can reach 75%. Units with high turnover (many short stays) may be closer to 55%.

### Do properties near Jonker Walk really earn that much more?
Yes, but the property prices are also higher. A condo near Jonker Walk might cost RM400-500k vs RM250-300k in other areas. The ROI is often similar when you factor in the property cost.
