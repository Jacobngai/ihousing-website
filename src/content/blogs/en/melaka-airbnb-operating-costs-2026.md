# Melaka Airbnb Operating Costs 2026: Hidden Leakages Eating Your ROI

Most property investors in Melaka look at two numbers: **The Installment** and **The Gross Revenue**. 

If the revenue is higher than the installment, they think they are making money. 

**This is a dangerous assumption.**

After 8 years of managing properties in Silverscape, Parkland, and Atlantis, we’ve seen that "Hidden Leakages" are what determine if an investment is a cash-cow or a money-pit. In 2026, with rising utility costs and service taxes, understanding your operating expenses is more critical than ever.

Here is the breakdown of the real costs of running an Airbnb in Melaka.

---

## 1. The Big Leak: Utilities (Electricity & Water)

Electricity is the single largest variable expense for any Melaka Airbnb. 

*   **The Problem:** Guests in Melaka come from the hot sun and immediately set the AC to 16°C. Then they go out for dinner at Jonker Street for 5 hours—**leaving the AC running.**
*   **The Cost:** In a 2-bedroom unit, unmanaged electricity can easily hit **RM400 - RM600 per month**. 
*   **The iHousing Fix:** We install energy-saving sensors and smart AC controllers. We also set "Comfort Zones" (22-24°C) that keep guests happy while preventing the compressor from running 24/7.

## 2. Maintenance & Wear and Tear (The Silent ROI Killer)

An Airbnb isn't a long-term rental. It has 10x the "human traffic."

*   **Plumbing:** Melaka’s hard water causes mineral buildup in heaters and taps. Expect to service your water heaters every 12 months.
*   **Painting & Scuffs:** Luggage wheels and kids leave marks. You should budget for a professional touch-up every 18 months to maintain your "Cleanliness" rating.
*   **Furniture Replacement:** Even high-quality mattresses sag and sofas stain. Budget **2% of your gross revenue** into a "Sinking Fund" for furniture replacement.

## 3. The Digital Leak: Platform Fees & Hidden Taxes

We covered this in our [Airbnb Commission Guide](/blog/airbnb-commission-rate-malaysia-2026), but it bears repeating.

*   **Service Tax (SST):** Digital services are taxed. 
*   **Transaction Fees:** If you aren't using a local payment gateway, you are losing **1.5% to 3%** on every booking due to currency conversion spreads.
*   **WiFi:** Don't get the basic 30Mbps plan. For a 5-star review in 2026, you need 100Mbps+ which costs **RM129 - RM159 per month**.

## 4. Consumables & Hospitality Kits

It's not just shampoo. It's the "forgotten" items:
*   Toilet paper, tissue, garbage bags.
*   Dish soap, laundry detergent (if you have a washer).
*   Coffee, sugar, creamer, and filtered water.
*   **The Cost:** Budget **RM5 - RM8 per booking** for high-quality consumables. Cheap soap leads to bad reviews.

## 5. Comparison: Do-It-Yourself vs. Professional Management

| Expense Item | DIY (Monthly Est.) | iHousing Flat Fee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electricity** | RM 500 (Unmanaged) | RM 300 (Smart Managed) |
| **Cleaning** | RM 80-120 / trip | Included in Service |
| **Maintenance** | On-call (Expensive) | In-house Team (Wholesale) |
| **Platform Fees** | 15% - 20% | Optimized Multi-Channel |
| **Your Time** | 20+ Hours | 0 Hours |

**The Reality:** Most DIY hosts in Melaka end up with a **Net Profit Margin of only 30-40%**. With iHousing’s Flat Fee model and energy management, our owners typically see a **Net Profit Margin of 60-70%**.

## How to Plug the Leakages Today

1.  **Check your TNB bill:** If it’s over RM400 for a 2-bedder, you have a leakage.
2.  **Inspect your heaters:** Mineral buildup reduces efficiency and increases power draw.
3.  **Switch to a Flat Fee Manager:** Stop paying percentage commissions that punish your success.
