## Is a MOTAC License Mandatory for Your Melaka Airbnb?

You’ve got the keys to your Melaka condo, the renovation looks great, and you’re ready to welcome your first guests. Then you hear the term "MOTAC license" and start wondering: *Am I operating legally? Will I get fined?*

If you’re a property owner in Melaka, you’re in one of the most Airbnb-friendly spots in Malaysia. But "friendly" doesn't mean "no rules." As we move through 2026, the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) is tightening its focus on Short-Term Rental Accommodations (STRAs).

**The short answer for 2026:** While a full hotel-style license isn't mandatory for individual condo units yet, registration and specific safety standards are becoming the "Gold Standard." Following this checklist doesn't just keep you legal—it protects your investment from future policy shifts.

In this guide, we’ll break down exactly what you need to stay compliant in Melaka, what’s coming next, and why "flying under the radar" is a risky strategy for 2026.

## 1. The 2026 Legal Landscape: State vs. Federal

In Malaysia, Airbnb legality is like a layer cake. You have federal guidelines (MOTAC), state guidelines (Melaka State Government), and building rules (Strata Management).

### Federal (MOTAC)
MOTAC oversees the tourism industry. Their main goal for 2026 is data collection. They want to know who is hosting, where, and how many guests are coming in. They have introduced a **Voluntary Registration Scheme**. While it’s technically "optional," many building managements in Melaka are now making this registration a requirement to allow STR operations.

### State (Melaka)
Melaka remains highly supportive of Airbnb because it drives tourism to Jonker Street and Klebang. Currently, there is no state-wide ban, unlike the strict 180-day limits seen in other regions. However, the state government encourages hosts to operate through registered management companies (like iHousing) to ensure guest quality.

### Building (Your JMC/MC)
This is the most important layer. Even if MOTAC says "Go," your Joint Management Body (JMB) can say "No." In 2026, we are seeing more Melaka condos implement **STR Guidelines**. If your building allows Airbnb, they will usually require you to submit a copy of your insurance and emergency contacts.

## 2. Your 2026 Compliance Checklist

If you want to operate a "Future-Proof" Airbnb in Melaka, here is the checklist we use for the 100+ properties we manage.

### ✅ Step 1: Strata Management Approval
Before you spend a ringgit on furniture, check your building’s house rules.
*   **Action:** Request a copy of the latest AGM minutes or House Rules.
*   **Look for:** Any mentions of "Short-Term Rental," "Commercial Use," or "Homestay Restrictions."
*   **iHousing Tip:** If the rules are vague, don't just hope for the best. We often help owners communicate professionally with management to show how we manage noise and guest quality.

### ✅ Step 2: MOTAC Registration (TOU)
Even if it's voluntary, we recommend all our owners register their units.
*   **Action:** Register your property under the *Tourism Accommodation Premises* category on the MOTAC website.
*   **Benefit:** You get a registration number that adds massive credibility to your Airbnb and Agoda listings. Guests feel safer booking a "registered" property.

### ✅ Step 3: Mandatory Safety Equipment
Safety isn't just a suggestion anymore; it’s a requirement for insurance validity.
*   **Fire Extinguisher:** 2kg dry powder (ABC) extinguisher, serviced annually with a valid BOMBA sticker.
*   **Smoke Detectors:** Battery-operated detectors in every bedroom and the living area.
*   **First Aid Kit:** A basic kit clearly marked and accessible.
*   **Emergency Floor Plan:** Posted behind the main door (just like a hotel).

### ✅ Step 4: Specialized STR Insurance
Your standard fire insurance provided by the bank is **NOT enough**. It usually excludes commercial activities like Airbnb.
*   **Action:** Get a Public Liability Insurance policy (minimum RM500,000 coverage).
*   **Why:** If a guest slips in your bathroom or a fire starts while they are cooking, your bank's insurance will likely reject the claim because the unit was being used for "business."

## 3. The "Melaka Standard" for Guest Records

One of the biggest changes in 2026 is the focus on security. To stay on the good side of Melaka authorities, you must keep a **Digital Guest Log**.

**What you need to record for every guest:**
1.  Full Name (as per IC or Passport)
2.  IC/Passport Number
3.  Contact Number
4.  Vehicle Plate Number (crucial for Melaka condo parking)
5.  Check-in and Check-out dates

**Why this matters:** If there is a security incident in the building, and you cannot provide guest details to the management or police, you could face an immediate ban from the building. At iHousing, we automate this process for our owners so the data is always ready and secure.

## 4. Common MOTAC Myths (Debunked)

**Myth #1: "I only have one unit, I don't need to care about MOTAC."**
**Reality:** While you might not be a "hotel," you are part of the tourism ecosystem. Regulatory bodies are moving toward a "per-unit" registration model. Starting early makes you a "grandfathered" host when the rules become mandatory.

**Myth #2: "Melaka is a heritage city, so Airbnb is illegal in the city center."**
**Reality:** Quite the opposite! Melaka heritage properties are some of the highest-earning Airbnbs. The key is complying with the **heritage preservation guidelines**, which focus more on the building's physical structure than the rental activity.

**Myth #3: "If I register for MOTAC, I have to pay Tourism Tax."**
**Reality:** Tourism Tax (TTx) of RM10 per room per night usually applies only to foreign guests and is typically collected by the platforms (like Airbnb/Agoda) or registered hotel operators. For individual condo owners, the focus is on *registration*, not tax collection—for now.

## 5. Preparing for 2027 and Beyond

Regulations are a moving target. Here’s what we expect to see in the next 18-24 months in the Melaka STR market:
*   **Mandatory Fire Certificates:** Small-scale STRs might need a simplified BOMBA certification.
*   **Local Council (MBMB/MPHTJ) Permits:** A small annual permit fee (estimated RM100-RM300) to operate.
*   **Quota Systems:** Some popular buildings might limit the total number of units allowed to do Airbnb.

**How to stay ahead:** Don't be a "ghost host." By registering with MOTAC now and maintaining professional standards, you build a history of compliance that makes it much easier to get a permanent license later.

## Why iHousing Owners Don’t Worry About MOTAC

Navigating licenses, strata rules, and BOMBA stickers isn't exactly "passive income." It’s a lot of paperwork and follow-up. 

That’s why iHousing handles the entire compliance suite for our owners. 
*   **Strata Liaison:** We talk to your building management so you don't have to.
*   **Safety Audits:** We ensure your unit has the right extinguishers and detectors.
*   **Digital Logs:** Our system automatically collects and stores guest ID data securely.
*   **Policy Updates:** When MOTAC changes the rules at 2 AM, we’re already working on the fix by 8 AM.

**Not sure if your Melaka property is fully compliant?**

## FAQ: Melaka Airbnb Licensing

### Do I need an SSM business registration to do Airbnb in Melaka?
It is recommended. Registering as a sole proprietorship under "Apartment/Penthouse Management" makes it easier to claim business expenses and look professional to building management.

### What happens if my JMB bans Airbnb?
You have two choices: Engage in a dialogue to propose professional management standards (which we can help with), or switch to a "Mid-Term" rental strategy (3-6 month stays), which usually bypasses STR bans.

### Is the MOTAC registration permanent?
Currently, registration is one-time, but it is expected to move to an annual renewal model to ensure host contact details stay updated.
