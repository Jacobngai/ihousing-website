# Novo 8 Residence Melaka: The Family-Friendly Airbnb Profit Machine

If you're looking for an Airbnb investment in Melaka, everyone tells you to look at Silverscape or The Shore. They aren't wrong—those are high-traffic areas. But there's a new player in town that is quietly eating their lunch when it comes to **family bookings**: Novo 8 Residence.

Located right next to the historic Kampung Morten, Novo 8 has become our go-to recommendation for investors who want stable, year-round occupancy without the "party crowd" drama of the city center.

We manage multiple units at Novo 8. Here is the real data on why this building is a profit machine for the right kind of investor.

## The "Family Factor": Why Novo 8 Fills Up Faster

Silverscape is great for couples and solo travelers who want to walk to Jonker Walk. But for a family of 6 from Singapore or KL with three kids and a grandmother, Silverscape can be a nightmare. The elevators are packed, the pool is crowded, and the noise level is high.

**Novo 8 wins families over because:**

1.  **Massive Amenities:** The pool area at Novo 8 looks more like a water park than a condo pool. There are dedicated kids' play areas that keep children occupied for hours. 
2.  **Quiet but Connected:** It's located in a more residential pocket. Guests get a quiet night's sleep, but they are still only a 5-minute Grab ride (RM5-7) from Jonker Walk.
3.  **Kampung Morten Views:** Guests love the "Old Melaka" vibe of looking out over the traditional Malay village. It’s a unique selling point that stands out in Airbnb photos.

## Real ROI: Novo 8 by the Numbers

Let's look at the actual performance of a typical 3-bedroom unit we manage at Novo 8 versus a similar 3-bedroom at Silverscape.

| Metric | Novo 8 (3-BR) | Silverscape (3-BR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Average Daily Rate (ADR)** | RM320 | RM380 |
| **Occupancy Rate** | 82% | 68% |
| **Monthly Gross Revenue** | **RM7,872** | **RM7,752** |
| **Maintenance Fees** | Lower (approx RM300) | Higher (approx RM450) |
| **Net Profit Margin** | **~62%** | **~54%** |

**The Insight:** Silverscape has a higher nightly rate, but Novo 8 has **significantly higher occupancy**. Families tend to stay longer (3-4 days) compared to the "weekend warriors" who only stay Friday and Saturday at Silverscape. Higher occupancy + lower maintenance fees = more RM in your pocket at the end of the month.

## The Flat Fee Advantage

At iHousing, we’ve seen too many owners at Novo 8 losing 20-25% of their hard-earned revenue to traditional commission-based managers. 

On a RM7,800 month, a 20% commission manager takes **RM1,560**.
With iHousing’s flat-fee model, you pay a fixed amount (e.g., RM300 for a 3-bedroom).

**That is RM1,260 extra per month staying in your bank account.** Over a year, that’s RM15,120—enough to pay for your property's installments for several months.

## 3 Tips to Maximize Your Novo 8 Unit

If you own a unit here or are planning to buy, here is what our data shows works best:

### 1. Optimize for "The Big Group"
Don't just provide 6 towels. Provide 10. Families have spills, they go to the pool twice a day, and they value abundance. A "family-ready" kit (baby high chair, basic board games, extra floor mattresses) can allow you to charge a RM50 premium per night over "standard" units.

### 2. Multi-Platform Strategy
Airbnb is only about 40% of our bookings at Novo 8. Because it's a family-centric building, we get massive traffic from **Agoda** and **Booking.com**. If your manager is only listing on Airbnb, you are leaving 60% of your potential revenue on the table.

### 3. Highlight the "Kampung Morten Walk"
In your listing, don't just say "Near city center." Tell them about the evening stroll through Kampung Morten to see the traditional houses lit up. It sells the *experience*, not just the room.

## Is Novo 8 Right for You?

**Invest in Novo 8 if:**
*   You want stable occupancy from families and longer-stay guests.
*   You prefer lower monthly maintenance overhead.
*   You want a building that is still "fresh" and well-maintained by the JMB.

**Skip Novo 8 if:**
*   You are chasing the absolute highest nightly rate (City center still wins here).
*   You only want "young and trendy" guests who want to be 2 minutes from a bar.
