# Pricing Your Melaka Airbnb: Strategies for Maximum Occupancy

You listed your Melaka condo, set a price, and... crickets. Or worse, bookings at rates that barely cover your cleaning fees. Sound familiar?

Pricing an Airbnb in Melaka isn't about guessing or copying the cheapest listing. It's about understanding local demand patterns, seasonal swings, and knowing exactly when to charge premium rates.

We manage 100+ properties in Melaka, so we've seen what works—and what doesn't. Here's how to price your Melaka Airbnb for maximum income.

## Understanding Melaka's Demand Patterns

Melaka isn't Kuala Lumpur. Our tourism follows different rhythms.

**Peak Periods (Charge Premium):**
- Malaysian school holidays (March, June, September, December)
- Public holidays: Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali
- Singapore long weekends (Friday-Sunday or Monday holidays)
- International school holidays (June-July, December)

**Shoulder Periods (Standard Pricing):**
- Regular weekends (year-round)
- Local festivals without public holidays

**Low Periods (Consider Discounts):**
- Weekdays (Monday-Thursday, excluding holidays)
- Ramadan (lower tourism traffic)
- Exam periods for local schools

**The Singapore Factor:**
Here's something many overlook—Singaporeans drive Melaka's weekend demand. When Singapore has a 3-day weekend, Melaka bookings spike Thursday night and Sunday morning. Check Singapore's public holiday calendar and adjust your Friday-Monday pricing accordingly.

## The Weekend Premium Strategy

Melaka is a weekend destination. Most guests check in Friday evening and check out Sunday.

**Pricing Formula:**
- Weekday rate (Monday-Thursday): Base rate
- Friday rate: +30-50%
- Saturday rate: +40-60%
- Sunday rate: Base rate (or +10-20% if it's a long weekend)

**Example (Jonker Walk Area):**
- Monday-Thursday: RM180/night
- Friday: RM240/night
- Saturday: RM280/night
- Sunday: RM200/night

**Why This Works:**
Weekend guests pay premium because they're limited to 2 nights. Weekday guests (often business travelers or locals) expect lower rates. By differentiating, you capture both markets without sacrificing weekend revenue.

## Location-Specific Pricing

Different areas command different rates. Here's what we see across Melaka:

| Area | Typical Weekend Rate | Target Guest | Notes |
|------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| Jonker Walk (within 5 min walk) | RM250-400 | Heritage tourists, couples | Highest rates, book out fast |
| Jonker Walk (5-10 min walk) | RM200-300 | Tourists, families | Good balance of price and convenience |
| Melaka Raya | RM180-280 | Business travelers, families | Central, good food scene |
| Klebang | RM150-250 | Families, beach-goers | Newer condos, pool facilities |
| Ayer Keroh | RM120-200 | Families, large groups | Budget-friendly, near attractions |
| Bachang | RM150-220 | Mixed, budget-conscious | Emerging area, good value |

**Insider Tip:**
Silverscape Residence (near Klebang) and Parkland Residence (near Melaka Raya) are investment hotspots. Both command RM200+ weekend rates with 70%+ monthly occupancy when priced correctly.

## Dynamic Pricing: When to Adjust

Set a base rate, then adjust based on demand triggers. Here's our pricing adjustment system:

**Increase Price (+20-50%):**
- Singapore long weekend (check calendar monthly)
- Malaysian school holiday week
- Major festivals (CNY, Hari Raya)
- Last-minute booking request (within 3 days of check-in)
- Only 1-2 dates left in a booking block

**Decrease Price (-15-25%):**
- 4+ empty consecutive weekday nights
- Last-minute gap (tonight available, low bookings)
- Off-season periods (Ramadan, exam weeks)
- Competitors showing significantly lower rates

**Keep Price Steady:**
- Regular weekends with standard occupancy
- Booked 1-2 weeks in advance at current rates
- Local events (not major holidays)

## The 70% Occupancy Sweet Spot

Here's a common mistake: chasing 100% occupancy by lowering prices. Wrong approach.

**The Math:**
- Option A: RM180/night, 100% occupancy = RM5,400/month (assuming 30 nights)
- Option B: RM220/night, 70% occupancy = RM4,620/month

Wait, Option A makes more? Not quite.

**Factor in Hidden Costs:**
- Cleaning: RM60-80 per turnover
- Utilities: Extra RM150-250/month for higher occupancy
- Wear and tear: Higher occupancy = more replacements

**Revised Math:**
- Option A (RM180, 100%): 30 bookings × (RM180 - RM70 cleaning) - RM200 utilities = **RM3,100 profit**
- Option B (RM220, 70%): 21 bookings × (RM220 - RM70 cleaning) - RM150 utilities = **RM3,000 profit**

Similar profit, but Option B has:
- Less guest turnover (21 vs 30 checkouts)
- Lower utility costs
- Less wear on furniture/appliances
- Better guest experience (fewer crowds, more attention)

**Target: 70-75% weekend occupancy at your target rate.** If you're consistently below, lower price. If you're booking 3+ weeks out, raise it.

## Minimum Stay Requirements

Minimum stay rules protect your income from low-value bookings.

**Standard Minimums:**
- Weekdays (Mon-Thu): 1 night minimum
- Weekends (Fri-Sun): 2 nights minimum
- Peak holidays (CNY, school holidays): 3 nights minimum

**The 1-Night Weekday Strategy:**
Some hosts avoid 1-night bookings (too much cleaning for 1 night's revenue). We say: take them.

**Why 1-Night Bookings Work:**
- Fills empty weekdays (better than RM0)
- Attracts business travelers (clean, respectful guests)
- Can convert into repeat guests
- Increases visibility (more reviews = better ranking)

**Exception:** If your cleaning fee exceeds 40% of your nightly rate, consider 2-night minimums for weekdays.

## Pricing for Different Property Types

Not all condos are the same. Adjust pricing based on your unit's actual features.

**Premium Features (+RM30-80/night):**
- Pool view / Sea view: +RM50-80
- Direct pool access (ground floor): +RM40-60
- Gym and full facilities: +RM30-50
- Renovated/modern interior: +RM40-60
- balcony with view: +RM30-50

**Location Premiums (+RM20-60/night):**
- Walking distance to Jonker: +RM40-60
- Walking distance to shopping mall (Mahkota Parade, Dataran Pahlawan): +RM30-50
- Near Melaka Raya food scene: +RM20-40
- Quiet residential area: +RM10-20 (families prefer this)

**Size Adjustments:**
- Studio/1-bedroom: Base rate
- 2-bedroom: +RM30-50
- 3-bedroom: +RM60-90

## The First Month: Finding Your Price

New listing? Don't guess. Use this testing strategy.

**Week 1-2: Start 10% Below Competitors**
- Research similar units in your area
- Set your price 10% lower than the median
- Track booking speed and inquiries

**Week 3-4: Analyze and Adjust**
- Booked out 2+ weeks in advance? Raise prices 10%
- Getting bookings but last-minute? Keep current price
- Few or no bookings? Lower another 10% or check your listing quality

**Month 2+: Fine-Tune**
- Increase Friday/Saturday rates first (weekend demand is highest)
- Test minimum stay requirements
- Monitor competitor prices weekly

**Red Flags (Price Too High):**
- Zero bookings in first week with good listing photos
- Competitors fully booked while you're empty
- Guests asking for discounts before booking

**Red Flags (Price Too Low):**
- Booked out 4+ weeks in advance immediately
- Guests mentioning "great price" in reviews
- Revenue below RM150/night for premium location

## Tools That Help

You don't need to manually update prices daily.

**Airbnb Smart Pricing:**
- Free, built-in
- Sometimes underprices (we've seen it suggest RM120 when RM200 is justified)
- Use as a baseline, then adjust manually

**Dynamic Pricing Tools (PriceLabs, Beyond Pricing):**
- Cost: RM50-100/month
- Automatically adjust based on demand, events, competitor rates
- Pay for themselves if you have 2+ units

**Manual Approach (Works for Single Units):**
- Set weekend premiums manually
- Check pricing monthly before school holidays
- Monitor competitor prices weekly

## Common Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Static Pricing**
Same price every night. This costs you 20-30% in potential revenue.

**Mistake 2: Underpricing to Get Reviews**
Some hosts price RM80 for a RM180 unit to get reviews, then jack up the price. Guests notice and leave reviews mentioning "used to be cheap." Better to price correctly from the start.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Minimum Stays During Peak Holidays**
Accepting 1-night bookings during CNY means you miss out on families wanting 3-4 nights. Set 3-night minimums for peak periods.

**Mistake 4: Not Raising Prices After Positive Reviews**
Once you have 10+ positive reviews, you can raise rates 10-15%. The reviews justify the premium.

**Mistake 5: Copying Competitor Prices Blindly**
That RM250 listing might be empty because it's overpriced—or booked solid because it's underpriced. Check occupancy, not just prices.

## Real Example: Silverscape Residence

Here's how we price a 2-bedroom unit at Silverscape Residence:

**Base Rates:**
- Monday-Thursday: RM180/night
- Friday: RM230/night (+28%)
- Saturday: RM260/night (+44%)
- Sunday: RM200/night (+11%)

**Adjustments:**
- Singapore long weekend: +30% on all nights
- Malaysian school holidays: +20% on weekends
- Last-minute (3 days out): -15% if still empty

**Results:**
- Average rate: RM195/night
- Occupancy: 73%
- Monthly income: ~RM4,260
- Cleaning cost: RM70/booking
- Net profit (after utilities): ~RM3,600/month

**Key Insight:**
This unit could rent at RM150/night and achieve 90% occupancy. But at RM180-260, we earn more profit with fewer guests and less turnover.

## The Bottom Line

Pricing your Melaka Airbnb isn't set-and-forget. It requires:

1. **Base rates** that reflect your property's value
2. **Weekend premiums** to capture Melaka's weekend demand
3. **Seasonal adjustments** for holidays and school breaks
4. **Regular monitoring** of competitor prices and occupancy

Start with a reasonable base rate, adjust weekend pricing first, then fine-tune based on booking patterns. You'll find your sweet spot within 2-3 months.
