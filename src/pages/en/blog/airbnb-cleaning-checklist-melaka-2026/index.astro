<h1>The Ultimate Airbnb Cleaning Checklist for Melaka Hosts (2026 Edition)</h1>

<p>Cleanliness is the single biggest factor in Airbnb reviews. A single missed spot can drop your rating from 5 stars to 3. In a competitive market like Melaka, where guests have hundreds of options, you cannot afford to slip up.</p>

<p>Whether you clean yourself or hire a service, this checklist ensures your property is always guest-ready.</p>

<h2>The Essential "Turnover" Checklist</h2>

</ul>

<h3>Bathroom</h3>

  <li>[ ] Clean shower glass (no water spots!)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Why Professional Cleaning Matters</h2>

<p>Doing this yourself takes 2-3 hours per turnover. If you have back-to-back bookings, it becomes a full-time job.</p>

<p>At iHousing, our professional cleaning team doesn't just clean; they inspect. We use a <strong>50-point quality assurance checklist</strong> for every turnover. We also manage linen laundry, restocking supplies, and maintenance checks simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ignoring smells:</strong> Musty odors from humidity are common in Melaka. Air out the unit and use dehumidifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Old sponges:</strong> Replace kitchen sponges frequently. A dirty sponge is a hygiene hazard.</li>
  <li><strong>Overlooking maintenance:</strong> A cleaner should report burnt-out bulbs or loose handles immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let Us Handle the Dirty Work</h2>

<p>Tired of scrubbing toilets? Let iHousing manage your cleaning and turnover. We ensure hotel-grade cleanliness for every guest.</p>
