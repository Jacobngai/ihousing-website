<h1>Airbnb vs. Long-Term Rental: Which is Better for Melaka Investors in 2026?</h1>

<p>Every property investor in Melaka faces the same dilemma: Do I sign a 1-year tenancy agreement (Long-Term Rental) or turn my unit into a vacation home (Short-Term Rental / Airbnb)?</p>

<p>Both strategies have pros and cons. Let's break down the financials and operational realities for 2026.</p>

<h2>1. Financial Returns (ROI)</h2>

<h3>Long-Term Rental (LTR)</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Consistent monthly income. Once a tenant signs, you know exactly what you'll get for the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lower ceiling. In Melaka, rental yields for condos typically hover around <strong>3-4%</strong>. You can't raise rent mid-lease even if market rates skyrocket.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Rental (Airbnb)</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Significantly higher potential. A well-managed unit in a prime location (like Avenue-by-the-Sea or near Jonker Street) can achieve <strong>6-10% yield</strong> or more.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fluctuating income. Some months (like school holidays) are booming; others (like Ramadan) might be slower.</p>

<h2>2. Flexibility & Control</h2>

<h3>Long-Term Rental</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Set it and forget it (mostly).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You lose access to your property. You can't use it for your own vacations. Evicting a bad tenant is a legal nightmare.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Rental</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Complete control. Block out dates for your own family holidays. If a guest breaks rules, they're gone in days, not months.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> High turnover means constant management (unless you hire a pro).</p>

<h2>3. Property Condition</h2>

<h3>Long-Term Rental</h3>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Tenants rarely treat a rental like their own home. After 2-3 years, you might face significant renovation costs due to wear and tear.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Rental</h3>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your property is cleaned professionally every few days. Maintenance issues are spotted and fixed immediately. In our experience, Airbnbs often stay in <strong>better condition</strong> than long-term rentals.</p>

<h2>The Verdict: Location Matters</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Suburban Areas (e.g., Bukit Beruang, Ayer Keroh):</strong> Better suited for LTR (targeting students/families).</li>
  <li><strong>Tourist Hotspots (e.g., Kota Laksamana, Melaka Raya, Klebang):</strong> Airbnb is the clear winner for ROI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Not Have Both?</h2>

<p>At iHousing, we specialize in maximizing returns for short-term rentals. We handle the intense operational load so you get the high ROI of Airbnb with the passive nature of long-term investing.</p>

<p><strong>Avenue-by-the-Sea Investors:</strong> This location is <em>built</em> for short-term rentals. Don't leave money on the table with a standard lease. Use our flat-rate management (RM200-300/month) to boost your yields.</p>
