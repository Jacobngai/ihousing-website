<h1>Avenue-by-the-Sea Melaka: Investment Review & Airbnb Potential (2026)</h1>

<p>Located in the heart of Melaka's booming coastal district, <strong>Avenue-by-the-Sea</strong> (also known as Parkland Avenue) has caught the attention of investors looking for high-yield short-term rental properties.</p>

<p>But does it live up to the hype? As property managers handling multiple units in this development, here is our honest 2026 review.</p>

<h2>The Location: Prime Coastal Strategy</h2>

<p>Avenue-by-the-Sea sits strategically near Klebang, famous for its beach, coconut shakes, and sand dunes. It's a short drive to Jonker Street but offers a resort-like atmosphere that city center condos lack.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beach Access:</strong> A major draw for families and weekenders from KL/Singapore.</li>
  <li><strong>Tranquility:</strong> Away from the traffic jams of the city center.</li>
  <li><strong>Developing Area:</strong> Property values are poised to rise as infrastructure improves.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distance to Heritage Sites:</strong> Guests need a car or Grab to visit A'Famosa (about 10-15 mins). Ideally suited for guests who drive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Facilities: Resort-Style Living</h2>

<p>This is where Avenue-by-the-Sea shines. The facilities are designed for vacationers, not just residents.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Water Park Features:</strong> The pool area is extensive, with slides and play zones for kids. This is a massive selling point for families.</li>
  <li><strong>Gym & Sauna:</strong> Well-maintained and modern.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> 3-tier security system gives guests peace of mind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Airbnb Performance Data (2025-2026)</h2>

<p>Based on our managed units, here is what investors can expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Average Occupancy:</strong> 65-75% (Higher on weekends/holidays).</li>
  <li><strong>Average Nightly Rate:</strong> RM180 - RM350 (depending on unit size/view).</li>
  <li><strong>Estimated Gross Yield:</strong> 6-9% per annum.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: These figures are estimates based on professional management optimization. Self-managed units often see lower occupancy due to poor pricing strategies.</em></p>

<h2>The Management Advantage: Flat Rate Fee</h2>

<p>Unlike other condos in Melaka where management fees can eat 30% of your revenue, <strong>Avenue-by-the-Sea owners enjoy a special advantage with iHousing.</strong></p>

<p>We offer a <strong>Flat Rate Management Fee</strong> specifically for this development:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Studio / 1-Bedroom:</strong> RM200/month</li>
  <li><strong>2-Bedroom / 3-Bedroom:</strong> RM300/month</li>
</ul>

<p>This model saves you thousands of Ringgit annually compared to percentage-based commissions. It aligns perfectly with high-performing assets—you keep the upside.</p>

<h2>Verdict: Buy or Pass?</h2>

<p><strong>Verdict: BUY (for Cash Flow).</strong></p>
<p>If your goal is strong monthly cash flow via Airbnb, Avenue-by-the-Sea is a top contender. The family-friendly facilities and our low management cost make it a high-ROI machine.</p>

<p><strong>Ready to turn your unit into a passive income generator?</strong></p>
