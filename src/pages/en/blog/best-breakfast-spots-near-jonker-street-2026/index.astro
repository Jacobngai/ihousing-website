<h1>5 Must-Try Breakfast Spots Near Jonker Street (Local Favorites 2026)</h1>

<p>Staying in an Airbnb near Jonker Street? While the night market is famous, Melaka's breakfast scene is equally legendary. But where do the locals actually eat?</p>

<p>Forget the long queues at the viral spots. Here are 5 hidden gems within walking distance of Jonker Street that offer an authentic taste of Melaka.</p>

<h2>1. Low Yong Moh Restaurant (Dim Sum)</h2>

<p>This is the oldest dim sum house in Melaka, operating since 1936! It's chaotic, noisy, and absolutely delicious. Don't expect fancy decor; come for the steaming baskets of siew mai and their signature oversized pau.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Big Pau (Da Bao) and Glutinous Rice (Lo Mai Gai).</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Go early (before 8 AM) to avoid the crowds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Jonker 88 (Nyonya Laksa)</h2>

<p>Okay, this one is famous, but for a reason. Their Nyonya Laksa is rich, creamy, and packed with flavor. The Cendol here is arguably the best in town, with generous lashings of Gula Melaka.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Nyonya Laksa Kahwin (mix of sour and curry laksa) and Durian Cendol.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Prepare for a wait, but it moves fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. The Daily Fix Cafe (Pancakes)</h2>

<p>Tucked behind a souvenir shop, this cafe is a beautiful oasis of calm. Their pandan pancakes are legendary – fluffy, fragrant, and served with Gula Melaka syrup.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Pandan Pancakes and Salted Gula Melaka Coffee.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Perfect for a late breakfast or brunch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Kedai Kopi Chung Wah (Chicken Rice Balls)</h2>

<p>You can't leave Melaka without trying Chicken Rice Balls. While there are several options, Chung Wah is consistently excellent. The rice is hand-rolled into golf-ball-sized spheres, served with tender poached chicken.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Half chicken and plenty of rice balls.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> It opens at 9 AM, so be there by 8:45 AM.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Lung Ann Refreshment (Kopitiam Toast)</h2>

<p>For a simple, traditional breakfast, head to Lung Ann. It's a classic kopitiam serving arguably the best kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs in town. Pair it with a cup of strong Kopi O.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must Order:</strong> Roti Bakar (Toast), Half-Boiled Eggs, and Kopi.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Satay is also served here in the mornings!</li>
</ul>
