<h1>Essential Guide to Melaka's UNESCO World Heritage Sites (2026)</h1>

<p>Melaka isn't just a city; it's a living museum. As a UNESCO World Heritage City, it boasts over 500 years of trading and colonial history. For travelers staying in short-term rentals, exploring these sites is the highlight of the trip.</p>

<p>Here is your essential guide to the key landmarks that define Melaka's unique heritage.</p>

<h2>1. The Dutch Square (Red Square)</h2>

<p>The iconic heart of Melaka. You can't miss the striking red buildings, a legacy of Dutch colonial rule.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Stadthuys:</strong> Built in 1650 as the official residence of Dutch governors, it's the oldest Dutch building in the East. Now the History and Ethnography Museum.</li>
  <li><strong>Christ Church:</strong> An 18th-century Anglican church known for its red bricks and white cross.</li>
  <li><strong>Queen Victoria's Fountain:</strong> A British addition in 1901 to commemorate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. A'Famosa Fortress (Porta de Santiago)</h2>

<h2>3. St. Paul's Hill (Bukit St. Paul)</h2>
