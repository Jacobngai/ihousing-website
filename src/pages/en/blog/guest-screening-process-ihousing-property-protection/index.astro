<h1>What Are the Guest Screening and Selection Processes for Airbnb Property Management?</h1>

<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 30px; border-left: 5px solid #007bff;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">TL;DR: Our 7-Step Guest Vetting System</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Government ID Verification:</strong> Mandatory for all bookings.</li>
    <li><strong>Review History Audit:</strong> Checking for prior issues or "red flag" host comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Booking Intent Analysis:</strong> Questioning the purpose of stay (family vs party).</li>
    <li><strong>Social Proof Check:</strong> Verifying profile photos and account age.</li>
    <li><strong>Deposit Management:</strong> Security deposits collected for high-risk profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>House Rule Acknowledgement:</strong> Mandatory confirmation of local Strata rules.</li>
    <li><strong>24/7 AI-Backed Monitoring:</strong> Flagging suspicious chat patterns.</li>
  </ol>

<p>When investing in Melaka property for Airbnb, the <strong>Guest Screening Process</strong> is your first line of defense against property damage, noise complaints, and legal issues with Strata committees.</p>

<p>With iHousing's 8 years of experience managing 100+ properties across Melaka, we've developed a rigorous selection process that maintains a 4.9-star average across our portfolio while protecting owners' assets.</p>

<h2>The Professional Screening Framework</h2>

<h3>1. Digital Identity Verification</h3>
<p>We only accept guests with verified government IDs on Airbnb, Booking.com, and Agoda. This ensures that if any damage occurs, we have the legal documentation required for insurance claims or security deposit deductions.</p>

<h3>2. Review Pattern Analysis</h3>
<p>We look beyond the star rating. Our team reads the *text* of previous host reviews. We watch for keywords like "noise," "smoking," "extra guests," or "late checkout." One bad review isn't always a dealbreaker, but a pattern of disrespect for house rules is an automatic rejection.</p>

<h3>3. Intent-Based Communication</h3>
<p>Every guest is asked: <em>"What is the purpose of your visit to Melaka?"</em> 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Family Vacation:</strong> Low risk, high value.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Gathering/Party:</strong> High risk, often violates Melaka Strata rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Trip:</strong> Very low risk, great for weekday occupancy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suspiciously vague answers or "locals looking for a staycation" are vetted with additional questions regarding the number of guests.</p>

<h3>4. House Rule Enforcement (Melaka Specific)</h3>
<p>Many Melaka condos (like Atlantis, Silverscape, and The Shore) have strict management rules. Part of our screening is ensuring guests explicitly acknowledge these rules—including pool attire and parking limits—before the booking is confirmed.</p>
