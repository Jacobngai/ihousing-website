## Common Concerns About Ong Kim Wee Residence

### "Is it too far from tourist attractions?"

**Answer**: It's a 5-7 minute drive to Jonker Street, which is perfectly acceptable for most guests. In fact, being slightly removed from the tourist center has advantages:

- Quieter environment (better reviews for peaceful sleep)
- Lower local food prices nearby
- Easier parking
- Less street noise and crowds

Most Airbnb guests in Melaka rent cars or use Grab. The distance is negligible.

### "Will I get enough bookings?"

**Answer**: Ong Kim Wee Residence's location and facilities appeal to multiple guest segments (families, business travelers, couples). This diversity reduces dependence on seasonal tourist traffic.

Properties in similar locations average 55-70% occupancy annually when professionally managed.

### "What about competition?"

**Answer**: Melaka has high demand, especially during:
- December-January (year-end holidays)
- February (Chinese New Year)
- June-July (school holidays)
- Long weekends

Ong Kim Wee Residence stands out with modern facilities. Many Melaka Airbnbs are older shophouses or outdated apartments. Your main competition is other newer condos, but the market can absorb more quality listings.
